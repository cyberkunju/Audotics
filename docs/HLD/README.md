# Audotics High-Level Design Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive high-level design documentation for the Audotics music recommendation platform.

## High-Level Design Overview

The high-level design documentation provides an architectural and system-level overview of the Audotics platform. It focuses on the broad structure of the system, major components, and their interactions, without delving into implementation details.

## Contents

- [System Architecture](system-architecture.md) - Overall system architecture and component relationships
- [Data Flow Diagrams](data-flow.md) - Visual representation of data flows between components
- [Component Specifications](component-specs.md) - Detailed specifications for major system components
- [Integration Architecture](integration-architecture.md) - Design for integration with external systems

## Purpose

This high-level design documentation serves several key purposes:

1. **Architectural Overview** - Provides a clear understanding of the system's overall structure
2. **Design Principles** - Documents the key design principles and architectural decisions
3. **System Boundaries** - Defines the boundaries and interfaces between system components
4. **Scalability Planning** - Documents how the system scales to handle increased load
5. **Technology Choices** - Explains the rationale behind key technology choices

## Audience

This documentation is intended for:

- System architects
- Development team leaders
- Senior developers
- Technical stakeholders
- Project managers
