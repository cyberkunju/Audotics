=======================================================================

  less than a minute

To launch automated tests or internal tools that log to W&B, create a **Service Account** on the team settings page. This action allows the use of a service API key for automated jobs, including those running through continuous integration. To attribute service account jobs to a specific user, set the `WANDB_USERNAME` or `WANDB_USER_EMAIL` environment variables.

Set the logging directory for W&B run data by configuring the environment variable `WANDB_DIR`. For example:

```
os.environ["WANDB_DIR"] = os.path.abspath("your/directory")

8 - Best practices to organize hyperparameter searches
======================================================

Set unique tags with `wandb.init(tags='your_tag')`. This allows efficient filtering of project runs by selecting the corresponding tag in a Project Page’s Runs Table.

For more information on wandb.int, see the [documentation](/ref/python/init/).

9 - Billing
===========

* [How do we update our payment method?](/support/update_payment_method/)
* [Is there a monthly subscription option for the teams plan?](/support/monthly_subscription_option_teams_plan/)

10 - Can I get an academic plan as a student?
=============================================

Students can apply for an academic plan by following these steps:

* Visit [the Pricing page on the wandb.com](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing).
* Apply for the academic plan.
* Alternatively, start with a 30-day trial and convert it to an academic plan by visiting <https://wandb.ai/academic_application>.

11 - Can I group runs without using the "Group" feature?
========================================================

Yes, you can also use tags or custom metadata to categorize runs. That can be done using the `Group` button which is available in the Workspace and Runs views of the project.

12 - Can I just log metrics, no code or dataset examples?
=========================================================

By default, W&B does not log dataset examples. By default, W&B logs code and system metrics.

Two methods exist to turn off code logging with environment variables:

1. Set `WANDB_DISABLE_CODE` to `true` to turn off all code tracking. This action prevents retrieval of the git SHA and the diff patch.
2. Set `WANDB_IGNORE_GLOBS` to `*.patch` to stop syncing the diff patch to the servers, while keeping it available locally for application with `wandb restore`.

As an administrator, you can also turn off code saving for your team in your team’s settings:

1. Navigate to the settings of your team at `https://wandb.ai/<team>/settings`. Where `<team>` is the name of your team.
2. Scroll to the Privacy section.
3. Toggle **Enable code saving by default**.

13 - Can I just set the run name to the run ID?
===============================================

Yes. To overwrite the run name with the run ID, use the following code snippet:

```
import wandb

wandb.init()
wandb.run.name = wandb.run.id
wandb.run.save()

```

14 - Can I log metrics on two different time scales?
====================================================

For example, I want to log training accuracy per batch and validation accuracy per epoch.

Yes, log indices like `batch` and `epoch` alongside your metrics. Use `wandb.log({'train_accuracy': 0.9, 'batch': 200})` in one step and `wandb.log({'val_accuracy': 0.8, 'epoch': 4})` in another. In the UI, set the desired value as the x-axis for each chart. To set a default x-axis for a specific index, use [Run.define\_metric()](/ref/python/run/#define_metric). For the example provided, use the following code:

```
wandb.init()

wandb.define_metric("batch")
wandb.define_metric("epoch")

wandb.define_metric("train_accuracy", step_metric="batch")
wandb.define_metric("val_accuracy", step_metric="epoch")

```

15 - Can I rerun a grid search?
===============================

If a grid search completes but some W&B Runs need re-execution due to crashes, delete the specific W&B Runs to re-run. Then, select the **Resume** button on the [sweep control page](/guides/sweeps/sweeps-ui/). Start new W&B Sweep agents using the new Sweep ID.

W&B Run parameter combinations that completed are not re-executed.

16 - Can I run wandb offline?
=============================

If training occurs on an offline machine, use the following steps to upload results to the servers:

1. Set the environment variable `WANDB_MODE=offline` to save metrics locally without an internet connection.
2. When ready to upload, run `wandb init` in your directory to set the project name.
3. Use `wandb sync YOUR_RUN_DIRECTORY` to transfer metrics to the cloud service and access results in the hosted web app.

To confirm the run is offline, check `run.settings._offline` or `run.settings.mode` after executing `wandb.init()`.

17 - Can I turn off wandb when testing my code?
===============================================

Use `wandb.init(mode="disabled")` or set `WANDB_MODE=disabled` to configure W&B as a no-operation (NOOP) for testing purposes.

Using `wandb.init(mode="disabled")` does not prevent W&B from saving artifacts to `WANDB_CACHE_DIR`.

18 - Can I use Markdown in my reports?
======================================

Yes. Type “/mark” anywhere in the document and press enter to insert a Markdown block. This allows editing with Markdown as before.

19 - Can I use Sweeps and SageMaker?
====================================

To authenticate W&B, complete the following steps: create a `requirements.txt` file if using a built-in Amazon SageMaker estimator. For details on authentication and setting up the `requirements.txt` file, refer to the [SageMaker integration](/guides/integrations/sagemaker/) guide.

Find a complete example on [GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/examples/tree/master/examples/pytorch/pytorch-cifar10-sagemaker) and additional insights on our [blog](https://wandb.ai/site/articles/running-sweeps-with-sagemaker).  
Access the [tutorial](https://wandb.ai/authors/sagemaker/reports/Deploy-Sentiment-Analyzer-Using-SageMaker-and-W-B--VmlldzoxODA1ODE) for deploying a sentiment analyzer using SageMaker and W&B.

20 - Can W&B team members see my data?
======================================

Key engineers and support staff at W&B access logged values for debugging purposes with user permission. All data stores encrypt data at rest, and audit logs record access. For complete data security from W&B employees, license the self-hosted solution to run a W&B server within your own infrastructure.

21 - Can we flag boolean variables as hyperparameters?
======================================================

Use the `${args_no_boolean_flags}` macro in the command section of the configuration to pass hyperparameters as boolean flags. This macro automatically includes boolean parameters as flags. If `param` is `True`, the command receives `--param`. If `param` is `False`, the flag is omitted.

22 - Can you group runs by tags?
================================

A run can have multiple tags, so grouping by tags is not supported. Add a value to the [`config`](/guides/track/config/) object for these runs and group by this config value instead. This can be accomplished using [the API](/guides/track/config/#set-the-configuration-after-your-run-has-finished).

23 - Can you use W&B Sweeps with cloud infrastructures such as AWS Batch, ECS, etc.?
====================================================================================

To publish the `sweep_id` so that any W&B Sweep agent can access it, implement a method for these agents to read and execute the `sweep_id`.

For example, launch an Amazon EC2 instance and execute `wandb agent` on it. Use an SQS queue to broadcast the `sweep_id` to multiple EC2 instances. Each instance can then retrieve the `sweep_id` from the queue and initiate the process.

24 - Charts

26 - Crashing And Hanging Runs
==============================

The following support questions are tagged with **Crashing And Hanging Runs**. If you don’t see
your question answered, try [asking the community](https://community.wandb.ai/),
or email [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com).

* [How can I fix the error `AttributeError: module 'wandb' has no attribute ...`?](/support/how_can_i_resolve_the_attributeerror_module_wandb_has_no_attribute/)

* [Why is a run marked crashed in W&B when it’s training fine locally?](/support/run_marked_crashed_wbs_training_fine_locally/)

27 - Do "Run Finished" alerts work in notebooks?
================================================

No. **Run Finished** alerts (activated with the **Run Finished** setting in User Settings) operate only with Python scripts and remain turned off in Jupyter Notebook environments to avoid notifications for each cell execution.

Use `wandb.alert()` in notebook environments instead.

28 - Do environment variables overwrite the parameters passed to wandb.init()?
==============================================================================

Arguments passed to `wandb.init` override environment variables. To set a default directory other than the system default when the environment variable isn’t set, use `wandb.init(dir=os.getenv("WANDB_DIR", my_default_override))`.

29 - Do I need to provide values for all hyperparameters as part of the W&B Sweep. Can I set defaults?
======================================================================================================

Access hyperparameter names and values from the sweep configuration using `wandb.config`, which acts like a dictionary.

For runs outside a sweep, set `wandb.config` values by passing a dictionary to the `config` argument in `wandb.init`. In a sweep, any configuration supplied to `wandb.init` serves as a default value, which the sweep can override.

Use `config.setdefaults` for explicit behavior. The following code snippets illustrate both methods:

* wandb.init()
* config.setdefaults()

```
# Set default values for hyperparameters
config_defaults = {"lr": 0.1, "batch_size": 256}

# Start a run and provide defaults
# that a sweep can override
with wandb.init(config=config_defaults) as run:
    # Add training code here
    ...

```

```
# Set default values for hyperparameters
config_defaults = {"lr": 0.1, "batch_size": 256}

# Start a run
with wandb.init() as run:
    # Update any values not set by the sweep
    run.config.setdefaults(config_defaults)

    # Add training code here

```

30 - Do you have a bug bounty program?
======================================

Weights and Biases has a bug bounty program. Access the security portal for details: <https://security.wandb.ai/>.

31 - Does logging block my training?
====================================

“Is the logging function lazy? I don’t want to depend on the network to send results to your servers while executing local operations.”

The `wandb.log` function writes a line to a local file and does not block network calls. When calling `wandb.init`, a new process starts on the same machine. This process listens for filesystem changes and communicates with the web service asynchronously, allowing local operations to continue uninterrupted.

32 - Does the W&B client support Python 2?
==========================================

The W&B client library supported both Python 2.7 and Python 3 through version 0.10. Support for Python 2.7 discontinued with version 0.11 due to Python 2’s end of life. Running `pip install --upgrade wandb` on a Python 2.7 system installs only new releases of the 0.10.x series. Support for the 0.10.x series includes critical bug fixes and patches only. The last version of the 0.10.x series that supports Python 2.7 is 0.10.33.

33 - Does the W&B client support Python 3.5?
============================================

The W&B client library supported Python 3.5 until version 0.11. Support for Python 3.5 ended with version 0.12, which aligns with its end of life. For more details, visit [version 0.12 release notes](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/releases/tag/v0.12.0).

34 - Does this only work for Python?
====================================

The library supports Python 2.7 and later, as well as Python 3.6 and later. The architecture facilitates integration with other programming languages. For monitoring other languages, contact [contact@wandb.com](mailto:contact@wandb.com).

35 - Does W&B support SSO for Multi-tenant?
===========================================

W&B supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for the Multi-tenant offering through Auth0. SSO integration is compatible with any OIDC-compliant identity provider, such as Okta or Azure AD. To configure an OIDC provider, follow these steps:

* Create a Single Page Application (SPA) on the identity provider.
* Set the `grant_type` to `implicit` flow.
* Set the callback URI to `https://wandb.auth0.com/login/callback`.

**Requirements for W&B**

After completing the setup, contact the customer success manager (CSM) with the `Client ID` and `Issuer URL` for the application. W&B will establish an Auth0 connection using these details and enable SSO.

36 - Does W&B use the `multiprocessing` library?
================================================

Yes, W&B uses the `multiprocessing` library. An error message like the following indicates a possible issue:

```
An attempt has been made to start a new process before the current process 
has finished its bootstrapping phase.

```

To resolve this, add an entry point protection with `if __name__ == "__main__":`. This protection is necessary when running W&B directly from the script.

37 - Does your tool track or store training data?
=================================================

Pass a SHA or unique identifier to `wandb.config.update(...)` to associate a dataset with a training run. W&B stores no data unless `wandb.save` is called with the local file name.

38 - Embedding Reports
======================

You can share your report by embedding it. Click the **Share** button at the top right of your report, then copy the embedded code from the bottom of the pop-up window.

41 - Filter and delete unwanted reports
=======================================

Use the search bar to filter the reports list. Select an unwanted report to delete it individually, or select all reports and click ‘Delete Reports’ to remove them from the project.

![Delete unwanted reports and drafts](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/reports/delete_runs.gif)

42 - How can I access the data logged to my runs directly and programmatically?
===============================================================================

The history object tracks metrics logged with `wandb.log`. Access the history object using the API:

```
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("username/project/run_id")
print(run.history())

```

43 - How can I be removed from a team?
======================================

A team admin can [remove you from a team](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/) from the **Users** tab of the team settings.

44 - How can I change how frequently to log system metrics?
===========================================================

To configure the frequency to log [system metrics](/guides/models/app/settings-page/system-metrics/), set `_stats_sampling_interval` to a number of seconds, expressed as a float. Default: `10.0`.

```
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(x_stats_sampling_interval=30.0))

```

45 - How can I change my account from corporate to academic?
============================================================

To change an account from corporate to academic in Weights & Biases, follow these steps:

1. **Link your academic email**:

   * Access account settings.
   * Add and set the academic email as the primary email.
2. **Apply for an academic plan**:

   * Visit the academic application page at <https://wandb.ai/academic_application>.
   * Submit the application for review.

46 - How can I change the colors of each run in the same group?
===============================================================

Changing the colors of individual runs within a group is not possible. All runs in the same group share a common color.

47 - How can I change the directory my sweep logs to locally?
=============================================================

Set the logging directory for W&B run data by configuring the environment variable `WANDB_DIR`. For example:

```
os.environ["WANDB_DIR"] = os.path.abspath("your/directory")

```

48 - How can I compare images or media across epochs or steps?
==============================================================

Expand the image panel and use the step slider to navigate through images from different steps. This process facilitates comparison of a model’s output changes during training.

49 - How can I configure the name of the run in my training code?
=================================================================

At the beginning of the training script, call `wandb.init` with an experiment name. For example: `wandb.init(name="my_awesome_run")`.

50 - How can I define the local location for `wandb` files?
===========================================================

* `WANDB_DIR=<path>` or `wandb.init(dir=<path>)`: Controls the location of the `wandb` folder created for your training script. Defaults to `./wandb`. This folder stores Run’s data and logs
* `WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR=<path>` or `wandb.Artifact().download(root="<path>")`: Controls the location where artifacts are downloaded. Defaults to `./artifacts`
* `WANDB_CACHE_DIR=<path>`: This is the location where artifacts are created and stored when you call `wandb.Artifact`. Defaults to `~/.cache/wandb`
* `WANDB_CONFIG_DIR=<path>`: Where config files are stored. Defaults to `~/.config/wandb`
* `WANDB_DATA_DIR=<PATH>`: Controls the location used for staging artifacts during upload. Defaults to `~/.cache/wandb-data/`.

51 - How can I delete multiple runs in bulk instead of one at a time?
=====================================================================

Use the [public API](/ref/python/public-api/api/) to delete multiple runs in a single operation:

```
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()
runs = api.runs('<entity>/<project>')
for run in runs:
    if <condition>:
        run.delete()

```

52 - How can I delete my user account?
======================================

Delete your user account by clicking **Delete account** in your [user settings](/guides/models/app/settings-page/user-settings/#delete-your-account). Note that this action is irreversible and it takes effect immediately.

53 - How can I disable logging of system metrics to W&B?
========================================================

To disable logging of [system metrics](/guides/models/app/settings-page/system-metrics/), set `_disable_stats` to `True`:

```
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(x_disable_stats=True))

```

54 - How can I fetch these Version IDs and ETags in W&B?
========================================================

If an artifact reference is logged with W&B and versioning is enabled on the buckets, the version IDs appear in the Amazon S3 UI. To retrieve these version IDs and ETags in W&B, fetch the artifact and access the corresponding manifest entries. For example:

```
artifact = run.use_artifact("my_table:latest")
for entry in artifact.manifest.entries.values():
    versionID = entry.extra.get("versionID")
    etag = entry.extra.get("etag")

```

55 - How can I find the artifacts logged or consumed by a run? How can I find the runs that produced or consumed an artifact?
=============================================================================================================================

W&B tracks artifacts logged by each run and those used by each run to construct an artifact graph. This graph is a bipartite, directed, acyclic graph with nodes representing runs and artifacts. An example can be viewed [here](https://wandb.ai/shawn/detectron2-11/artifacts/dataset/furniture-small-val/06d5ddd4deeb2a6ebdd5/graph) (click “Explode” to expand the graph).

Use the Public API to navigate the graph programmatically, starting from either an artifact or a run.

* From an Artifact
* From a Run

```
api = wandb.Api()

artifact = api.artifact("project/artifact:alias")

# Walk up the graph from an artifact:
producer_run = artifact.logged_by()
# Walk down the graph from an artifact:
consumer_runs = artifact.used_by()

# Walk down the graph from a run:
next_artifacts = consumer_runs[0].logged_artifacts()
# Walk up the graph from a run:
previous_artifacts = producer_run.used_artifacts()

```

```
api = wandb.Api()

run = api.run("entity/project/run_id")

# Walk down the graph from a run:
produced_artifacts = run.logged_artifacts()
# Walk up the graph from a run:
consumed_artifacts = run.used_artifacts()

# Walk up the graph from an artifact:
earlier_run = consumed_artifacts[0].logged_by()
# Walk down the graph from an artifact:
consumer_runs = produced_artifacts[0].used_by()

```

56 - How can I fix an error like `AttributeError: module 'wandb' has no attribute ...`?
=======================================================================================

If you encounter an error like `AttributeError: module 'wandb' has no attribute 'init'` or `AttributeError: module 'wandb' has no attribute 'login'` when importing `wandb` in Python, `wandb` is not installed or the installation is corrupted, but a `wandb` directory exists in the current working directory. To fix this error, uninstall `wandb`, delete the directory, then install `wandb`:

```
pip uninstall wandb; rm -rI wandb; pip install wandb

```

57 - How can I log a metric that doesn't change over time such as a final evaluation accuracy?
==============================================================================================

Using `wandb.log({'final_accuracy': 0.9})` updates the final accuracy correctly. By default, `wandb.log({'final_accuracy': <value>})` updates `wandb.settings['final_accuracy']`, which reflects the value in the runs table.

58 - How can I log additional metrics after a run completes?
============================================================

There are several ways to manage experiments.

For complex workflows, use multiple runs and set the group parameters in [`wandb.init`](/guides/track/launch/) to a unique value for all processes within a single experiment. The [**Runs** tab](/guides/track/project-page/#runs-tab) will group the table by group ID, ensuring that visualizations function properly. This approach enables concurrent experiments and training runs while logging results in one location.

For simpler workflows, call `wandb.init` with `resume=True` and `id=UNIQUE_ID`, then call `wandb.init` again with the same `id=UNIQUE_ID`. Log normally with [`wandb.log`](/guides/track/log/) or `wandb.summary`, and the run values will update accordingly.

59 - How can I log in to W&B Server?
====================================

Set the login URL by either of these methods:

* Set the [environment variable](/guides/track/environment-variables/) `WANDB_BASE_URL` to the Server URL.
* Set the `--host` flag of [`wandb login`](/ref/cli/wandb-login/) to the Server URL.

60 - How can I make my project public?
======================================

To make a project public, follow these steps:

1. Access the project page in the Weights & Biases web app.
2. Click the lock icon in the navigation bar to open privacy settings.
3. Choose “Public” to allow visibility for anyone.
4. Save the changes.

If the “Public” option is not available due to restrictions, consider the following options:

* Share a view-only link via a report.
* Contact the organization’s admin for assistance.
* Check account settings to confirm permission for public projects.

61 - How can I organize my logged charts and media in the W&B UI?
=================================================================

The `/` character separates logged panels in the W&B UI. By default, the segment of the logged item’s name before the `/` defines a group of panels known as a “Panel Section.”

```
wandb.log({"val/loss": 1.1, "val/acc": 0.3})
wandb.log({"train/loss": 0.1, "train/acc": 0.94})

```

In the [Workspace](/guides/track/project-page/#workspace-tab) settings, adjust the grouping of panels based on either the first segment or all segments separated by `/`.

62 - How can I overwrite the logs from previous steps?
======================================================

To overwrite logs from previous steps, use [forking](/guides/runs/forking/) and [rewind](/guides/runs/rewind/).

63 - How can I recover deleted runs?
====================================

To recover deleted runs, complete the following steps:

* Navigate to the Project Overview page.
* Click the three dots in the top right corner.
* Select **Undelete recently deleted runs**.

**Notes**:

* You can only restore runs deleted within the last 7 days.
* You can manually upload logs using the W&B API if undelete is not an option.

64 - How can I regain access to my account if I cannot receive a password reset email?
======================================================================================

To regain access to an account when unable to receive a password reset email:

1. **Check Spam or Junk Folders:** Ensure the email is not filtered there.
2. **Verify Email:** Confirm the correct email associated with the account.
3. **Check for SSO Options:** Use services like “Sign in with Google” if available.
4. **Contact Support:** If issues persist, reach out to support ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)) and provide your username and email for assistance.

65 - How can I remove projects from a team space without admin privileges?
==========================================================================

To remove projects from a team space without admin privileges, follow these options:

* Request that a current admin remove the projects.
* Ask the admin to grant temporary access for project management.

If unable to contact the admin, reach out to a billing admin or another authorized user in your organization for assistance.

66 - How can I resolve login issues with my account?
====================================================

To resolve login issues, follow these steps:

* **Verify access**: Confirm you are using the correct email or username and check membership in relevant teams or projects.
* **Browser troubleshooting**:
  + Use an incognito window to avoid cached data interference.
  + Clear the browser cache.
  + Attempt to log in from a different browser or device.
* **SSO and permissions**:
  + Verify the identity provider (IdP) and Single Sign-On (SSO) settings.
  + If using SSO, confirm inclusion in the appropriate SSO group.
* **Technical problems**:
  + Take note of specific error messages for further troubleshooting.
  + Contact the support team for additional assistance if issues persist.

67 - How can I resolve the Filestream rate limit exceeded error?
================================================================

To resolve the “Filestream rate limit exceeded” error in Weights & Biases (W&B), follow these steps:

**Optimize logging**:

* Reduce logging frequency or batch logs to decrease API requests.
* Stagger experiment start times to avoid simultaneous API requests.

**Check for outages**:

* Verify that the issue does not arise from a temporary server-side problem by checking [W&B status updates](https://status.wandb.com).

**Contact support**:

* Reach out to W&B support ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)) with details of the experimental setup to request an increase in rate limits.

68 - How can I resume a sweep using Python code?
================================================

To resume a sweep, pass the `sweep_id` to the `wandb.agent()` function.

```
import wandb

sweep_id = "your_sweep_id"

def train():
    # Training code here
    pass

wandb.agent(sweep_id=sweep_id, function=train)

```

69 - How can I rotate or revoke access?
=======================================

Personal and service account keys can be rotated or revoked. Create a new API key or service account user, then reconfigure scripts to use the new key. After reconfiguration, remove the old API key from your profile or team.

70 - How can I save the git commit associated with my run?
==========================================================

When `wandb.init` is invoked, the system automatically collects git information, including the remote repository link and the SHA of the latest commit. This information appears on the [run page](/guides/runs/#view-logged-runs). Ensure the current working directory when executing the script is within a git-managed folder to view this information.

The git commit and the command used to run the experiment remain visible to the user but are hidden from external users. In public projects, these details remain private.

71 - How can I see files that do not appear in the Files tab?
=============================================================

The Files tab shows a maximum of 10,000 files. To download all files, use the [public API](/ref/python/public-api/api/):

```
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run('<entity>/<project>/<run_id>')
run.file('<file>').download()

for f in run.files():
    if <condition>:
        f.download()

```

72 - How can I see the bytes stored, bytes tracked and tracked hours of my organization?
========================================================================================

View the bytes stored, bytes tracked, and tracked hours for your organization within organization settings:

1. Navigate to your organization’s settings at `https://wandb.ai/account-settings/<organization-name>/settings`.
2. Select the **Billing** tab.
3. Within the **Usage this billing period** section, select **View usage** button.

Ensure to replace values enclosed in `<>` with your organization’s name.

73 - How can I send run alerts to Microsoft Teams?
==================================================

To receive W&B alerts in Teams, follow these steps:

* **Set up an email address for your Teams channel.** Create an email address for the Teams channel where you want to receive alerts.
* **Forward W&B alert emails to the Teams channel’s email address.** Configure W&B to send alerts via email, then forward these emails to your Teams channel’s email.

74 - How can I use wandb with multiprocessing, e.g. distributed training?
=========================================================================

If a training program uses multiple processes, structure the program to avoid making wandb method calls from processes without `wandb.init()`.

Manage multiprocess training using these approaches:

1. Call `wandb.init` in all processes and use the [group](/guides/runs/grouping/) keyword argument to create a shared group. Each process will have its own wandb run, and the UI will group the training processes together.
2. Call `wandb.init` from only one process and pass data to log through [multiprocessing queues](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#exchanging-objects-between-processes).

Refer to the [Distributed Training Guide](/guides/track/log/distributed-training/) for detailed explanations of these approaches, including code examples with Torch DDP.

75 - How do I add Plotly or Bokeh Charts into Tables?
=====================================================

Direct integration of Plotly or Bokeh figures into tables is not supported. Instead, export the figures to HTML and include the HTML in the table. Below are examples demonstrating this with interactive Plotly and Bokeh charts.

* Using Plotly
* Using Bokeh

```
import wandb
import plotly.express as px

# Initialize a new run
run = wandb.init(project="log-plotly-fig-tables", name="plotly_html")

# Create a table
table = wandb.Table(columns=["plotly_figure"])

# Define path for Plotly figure
path_to_plotly_html = "./plotly_figure.html"

# Create a Plotly figure
fig = px.scatter(x=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], y=[0, 1, 4, 9, 16])

# Export Plotly figure to HTML
# Setting auto_play to False prevents animated Plotly charts from playing automatically
fig.write_html(path_to_plotly_html, auto_play=False)

# Add Plotly figure as HTML file to the table
table.add_data(wandb.Html(path_to_plotly_html))

# Log Table
run.log({"test_table": table})
wandb.finish()

```

```
from scipy.signal import spectrogram
import holoviews as hv
import panel as pn
from scipy.io import wavfile
import numpy as np
from bokeh.resources import INLINE

hv.extension("bokeh", logo=False)
import wandb

def save_audio_with_bokeh_plot_to_html(audio_path, html_file_name):
    sr, wav_data = wavfile.read(audio_path)
    duration = len(wav_data) / sr
    f, t, sxx = spectrogram(wav_data, sr)
    spec_gram = hv.Image((t, f, np.log10(sxx)), ["Time (s)", "Frequency (Hz)"]).opts(
        width=500, height=150, labelled=[]
    )
    audio = pn.pane.Audio(wav_data, sample_rate=sr, name="Audio", throttle=500)
    slider = pn.widgets.FloatSlider(end=duration, visible=False)
    line = hv.VLine(0).opts(color="white")
    slider.jslink(audio, value="time", bidirectional=True)
    slider.jslink(line, value="glyph.location")
    combined = pn.Row(audio, spec_gram * line, slider).save(html_file_name)

html_file_name = "audio_with_plot.html"
audio_path = "hello.wav"
save_audio_with_bokeh_plot_to_html(audio_path, html_file_name)

wandb_html = wandb.Html(html_file_name)
run = wandb.init(project="audio_test")
my_table = wandb.Table(columns=["audio_with_plot"], data=[[wandb_html], [wandb_html]])
run.log({"audio_table": my_table})
run.finish()

```

76 - How do I best log models from runs in a sweep?
===================================================

One effective approach for logging models in a [sweep](/guides/sweeps/) involves creating a model artifact for the sweep. Each version represents a different run from the sweep. Implement it as follows:

```
wandb.Artifact(name="sweep_name", type="model")

```

77 - How do I cancel my subscription?
=====================================

* Contact the support team ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)).
* Provide the organization name, email associated with the account, and username.

78 - How do I change my billing address?
========================================

To change the billing address, contact the support team ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)).

79 - How do I deal with network issues?
=======================================

If you encounter SSL or network errors, such as `wandb: Network error (ConnectionError), entering retry loop`, use the following solutions:

1. Upgrade the SSL certificate. On an Ubuntu server, run `update-ca-certificates`. A valid SSL certificate is essential for syncing training logs to mitigate security risks.
2. If the network connection is unstable, operate in offline mode by setting the [optional environment variable](/guides/track/environment-variables/#optional-environment-variables) `WANDB_MODE` to `offline`, and sync files later from a device with Internet access.
3. Consider using [W&B Private Hosting](/guides/hosting/), which runs locally and avoids syncing to cloud servers.

For the `SSL CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error, this issue might stem from a company firewall. Configure local CAs and execute:

`export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

80 - How do I delete a panel grid?
==================================

Select the panel grid and press delete or backspace. Click the drag handle in the top-right corner to select the panel grid.

83 - How do I downgrade my subscription plan?
=============================================

To downgrade a subscription plan, contact the support team at [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com) with your current plan details and the desired plan.

84 - How do I enable code logging with Sweeps?
==============================================

To enable code logging for sweeps, add `wandb.log_code()` after initializing the W&B Run. This action is necessary even when code logging is enabled in the W&B profile settings. For advanced code logging, refer to the [docs for `wandb.log_code()` here](/ref/python/run/#log_code).

85 - How do I export a list of users from my W&B Organisation?
==============================================================

To export a list of users from a W&B organization, an admin uses the SCIM API with the following code:

```
import base64
import requests

def encode_base64(username, key):
    auth_string = f'{username}:{key}'
    return base64.b64encode(auth_string.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')

username = ''  # Organization admin username
key = ''  # API key
scim_base_url = 'https://api.wandb.ai/scim/v2'
users_endpoint = f'{scim_base_url}/Users'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Basic {encode_base64(username, key)}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/scim+json'
}

response = requests.get(users_endpoint, headers=headers)
users = []
for user in response.json()['Resources']:
    users.append([user['userName'], user['emails']['Value']])

```

Modify the script to save the output as needed.

86 - How do I find an artifact from the best run in a sweep?
============================================================

To retrieve artifacts from the best performing run in a sweep, use the following code:

```
api = wandb.Api()
sweep = api.sweep("entity/project/sweep_id")
runs = sorted(sweep.runs, key=lambda run: run.summary.get("val_acc", 0), reverse=True)
best_run = runs[0]
for artifact in best_run.logged_artifacts():
    artifact_path = artifact.download()
    print(artifact_path)

```

87 - How do I find my API key?
==============================

To find your API key for Weights and Biases (W&B):

* Log in to W&B at <https://wandb.ai/authorize>.

89 - How do I fix the error `resume='must' but run (<run\_id>) doesn't exist`?
==============================================================================

If you encounter the error `resume='must' but run (<run_id>) doesn't exist`, the run you are attempting to resume does not exist within the project or entity. Ensure that you are logged in to the correct instance and that the project and entity are set:

```
wandb.init(entity=<entity>, project=<project>, id=<run-id>, resume='must')

```

Run [`wandb login --relogin`](/ref/cli/wandb-login/) to verify that you are authenticated.

90 - How do I get added to a team on W&B?
=========================================

To join a team, follow these steps:

Call `wandb.run.save()` to save the current run. Retrieve the name using `wandb.run.name`.

92 - How do I handle the 'Failed to query for notebook' error?
==============================================================

If you encounter the error message `"Failed to query for notebook name, you can set it manually with the WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME environment variable,"` resolve it by setting the environment variable. Multiple methods accomplish this:

* Notebook
* Python

```
%env "WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME" "notebook name here"

```

```
import os

os.environ["WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME"] = "notebook name here"

```

93 - How do I insert a table?
=============================

Tables remain the only feature from Markdown without a direct WYSIWYG equivalent. To add a table, insert a Markdown block and create the table inside it.

94 - How do I install the wandb Python library in environments without gcc?
===========================================================================

If an error occurs when installing `wandb` that states:

```
unable to execute 'gcc': No such file or directory
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

```

Install `psutil` directly from a pre-built wheel. Determine your Python version and operating system at <https://pywharf.github.io/pywharf-pkg-repo/psutil>.

For example, to install `psutil` on Python 3.8 in Linux:

```
WHEEL_URL=https://github.com/pywharf/pywharf-pkg-repo/releases/download/psutil-5.7.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl#sha256=adc36dabdff0b9a4c84821ef5ce45848f30b8a01a1d5806316e068b5fd669c6d
pip install $WHEEL_URL

```

After installing `psutil`, run `pip install wandb` to complete the installation of `wandb`.

95 - How do I kill a job with wandb?
====================================

Press `Ctrl+D` on the keyboard to stop a script instrumented with W&B.

96 - How do I launch multiple runs from one script?
===================================================

Use `wandb.init` and `run.finish()` to log multiple runs within a single script:

1. Use `run = wandb.init(reinit=True)` to allow reinitialization of runs.
2. Call `run.finish()` at the end of each run to complete logging.

```
import wandb

for x in range(10):
    run = wandb.init(reinit=True)
    for y in range(100):
        wandb.log({"metric": x + y})
    run.finish()

```

Alternatively, utilize a Python context manager to automatically finish logging:

```
import wandb

for x in range(10):
    run = wandb.init(reinit=True)
    with run:
        for y in range(100):
            run.log({"metric": x + y})

```

97 - How do I log a list of values?
===================================

These examples show logging losses a couple of different ways using [`wandb.log()`](/ref/python/log/).

* Using a dictionary
* As a histogram

```
wandb.log({f"losses/loss-{ii}": loss for ii, 
  loss in enumerate(losses)})

```

```
# Converts losses to a histogram
wandb.log({"losses": wandb.Histogram(losses)})  

```

For more, see [the documentation on logging](/guides/track/log/).

98 - How do I log an artifact to an existing run?
=================================================

Occasionally, it is necessary to mark an artifact as the output of a previously logged run. In this case, reinitialize the old run and log new artifacts as follows:

```
with wandb.init(id="existing_run_id", resume="allow") as run:
    artifact = wandb.Artifact("artifact_name", "artifact_type")
    artifact.add_file("my_data/file.txt")
    run.log_artifact(artifact)

```

99 - How do I log runs launched by continuous integration or internal tools?
============================================================================

To launch automated tests or internal tools that log to W&B, create a **Service Account** on the team settings page. This action allows the use of a service API key for automated jobs, including those running through continuous integration. To attribute service account jobs to a specific user, set the `WANDB_USERNAME` or `WANDB_USER_EMAIL` environment variables.

![Create a service account on your team settings page for automated jobs](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/track/common_questions_automate_runs.png)

100 - How do I log to the right wandb user on a shared machine?
===============================================================

When using a shared machine, ensure that runs log to the correct WandB account by setting the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication. If sourced in the environment, this variable provides the correct credentials upon login. Alternatively, set the environment variable directly in the script.

Execute the command `export WANDB_API_KEY=X`, replacing X with your API key. Logged-in users can find their API key at [wandb.ai/authorize](https://app.wandb.ai/authorize).

101 - How do I plot multiple lines on a plot with a legend?
===========================================================

Create a multi-line custom chart with `wandb.plot.line_series()`. Navigate to the [project page](/guides/track/project-page/) to view the line chart. To add a legend, include the `keys` argument in `wandb.plot.line_series()`. For example:

```
wandb.log(
    {
        "my_plot": wandb.plot.line_series(
            xs=x_data, ys=y_data, keys=["metric_A", "metric_B"]
        )
    }
)

```

Refer to additional details about multi-line plots [here](/guides/track/log/plots/#basic-charts) under the **Multi-line** tab.

102 - How do I programmatically access the human-readable run name?
===================================================================

The `.name` attribute of a [`wandb.Run`](/ref/python/run/) is accessible as follows:

```
import wandb

wandb.init()
run_name = wandb.run.name

```

103 - How do I rename a project?
================================

To rename a project:

* Navigate to the Project overview.
* Click on **Edit Project**.

106 - How do I resolve a run initialization timeout error in wandb?
===================================================================

To resolve a run initialization timeout error, follow these steps:

* **Retry initialization**: Attempt to restart the run.
* **Check network connection**: Confirm a stable internet connection.
* **Update wandb version**: Install the latest version of wandb.
* **Increase timeout settings**: Modify the `WANDB_INIT_TIMEOUT` environment variable:

  ```
  import os
  os.environ['WANDB_INIT_TIMEOUT'] = '600'

  ```
* **Enable debugging**: Set `WANDB_DEBUG=true` and `WANDB_CORE_DEBUG=true` for detailed logs.
* **Verify configuration**: Check that the API key and project settings are correct.
* **Review logs**: Inspect `debug.log`, `debug-internal.log`, `debug-core.log`, and `output.log` for errors.

107 - How do I resolve permission errors when logging a run?
============================================================

To resolve permission errors when logging a run to a W&B entity, follow these steps:

* **Verify entity and project names**: Ensure correct spelling and case sensitivity of the W&B entity and project names in your code.
* **Confirm permissions**: Ensure necessary permissions have been granted by the administrator.
* **Check log-in credentials**: Confirm log-in to the correct W&B account. Test by creating a run with the following code:

  ```
  import wandb

  run = wandb.init(entity="your_entity", project="your_project")
  run.log({'example_metric': 1})
  run.finish()

  ```
* **Set API key**: Use the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable:

  ```
  export WANDB_API_KEY='your_api_key'

  ```
* **Confirm host information**: For custom deployments, set the host URL:

  ```
  wandb login --relogin --host=<host-url>
  export WANDB_BASE_URL=<host-url>

  ```

108 - How do I save code?‌
==========================

Use `save_code=True` in `wandb.init` to save the main script or notebook that launches the run. To save all code for a run, version the code with Artifacts. The following example demonstrates this process:

```
code_artifact = wandb.Artifact(type="code")
code_artifact.add_file("./train.py")
wandb.log_artifact(code_artifact)

```

109 - How do I set a retention or expiration policy on my artifact?
===================================================================

To manage artifacts that contain sensitive data or to schedule the deletion of artifact versions, set a TTL (time-to-live) policy. For detailed instructions, refer to the [TTL guide](/guides/artifacts/ttl/).

110 - How do I silence W&B info messages?
=========================================

To suppress log messages in your notebook such as this:

```
INFO SenderThread:11484 [sender.py:finish():979]

```

Set the log level to `logging.ERROR` to only show errors, suppressing output of info-level log output.

```
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)

```

To turn off log output completely, set the `WANDB_SILENT` environment variable. This must occur in a notebook cell before running `wandb.login`:

* Notebook
* Python

```
%env WANDB_SILENT=True

```

```
import os

os.environ["WANDB_SILENT"] = "True"

```

111 - How do I stop wandb from writing to my terminal or my Jupyter notebook output?
====================================================================================

Set the environment variable [`WANDB_SILENT`](/guides/track/environment-variables/) to `true`.

* Python
* Notebook
* Command-Line

```
os.environ["WANDB_SILENT"] = "true"

```

```
%env WANDB_SILENT=true

```

```
WANDB_SILENT=true

```

112 - How do I switch between accounts on the same machine?
===========================================================

To manage two W&B accounts from the same machine, store both API keys in a file. Use the following code in your repositories to switch between keys securely, preventing secret keys from being checked into source control.

```
if os.path.exists("~/keys.json"):
    os.environ["WANDB_API_KEY"] = json.loads("~/keys.json")["work_account"]

```

113 - How do I turn off logging?
================================

The command `wandb offline` sets the environment variable `WANDB_MODE=offline`, preventing data from syncing to the remote W&B server. This action affects all projects, stopping the logging of data to W&B servers.

To suppress warning messages, use the following code:

```
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)

```

114 - How do I use custom CLI commands with sweeps?
===================================================

You can use W&B Sweeps with custom CLI commands if training configuration passes command-line arguments.

In the example below, the code snippet illustrates a bash terminal where a user trains a Python script named `train.py`, providing values that the script parses:

```
/usr/bin/env python train.py -b \
    your-training-config \
    --batchsize 8 \
    --lr 0.00001

```

To implement custom commands, modify the `command` key in the YAML file. Based on the previous example, the configuration appears as follows:

```
program:
  train.py
method: grid
parameters:
  batch_size:
    value: 8
  lr:
    value: 0.0001
command:
  - ${env}
  - python
  - ${program}
  - "-b"
  - your-training-config
  - ${args}

```

The `${args}` key expands to all parameters in the sweep configuration, formatted for `argparse` as `--param1 value1 --param2 value2`.

For additional arguments outside of `argparse`, implement the following:

```
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
args, unknown = parser.parse_known_args()

```

Depending on the environment, `python` might refer to Python 2. To ensure invocation of Python 3, use `python3` in the command configuration:

```
program:
  script.py
command:
  - ${env}
  - python3
  - ${program}
  - ${args}

```

115 - How do I use the resume parameter when resuming a run in W&B?
===================================================================

To use the `resume` parameter in W&B , set the `resume` argument in `wandb.init()` with `entity`, `project`, and `id` specified. The `resume` argument accepts values of `"must"` or `"allow"`.

```
run = wandb.init(entity="your-entity", project="your-project", id="your-run-id", resume="must")

```

116 - How do we update our payment method?
==========================================

To update your payment method, follow these steps:

1. **Go to your profile page**: First, navigate to your user profile page.
2. **Select your Organization**: Choose the relevant organization from the Account selector.
3. **Access Billing settings**: Under **Account**, select **Billing**.
4. **Add a new payment method**:
   * Click **Add payment method**.
   * Enter your new card details and select the option to make it your **primary** payment method.

> **Note:** To manage billing, you must be assigned as the billing admin for your organization.

117 - How do you delete a custom chart preset?
==============================================

Access the custom chart editor. Click on the currently selected chart type to open a menu displaying all presets. Hover over the preset to delete, then click the Trash icon.

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/app_ui/delete_custome_chart_preset.gif)

118 - How do you show a "step slider" in a custom chart?
========================================================

Enable this option on the “Other settings” page of the custom chart editor. Changing the query to use a `historyTable` instead of a `summaryTable` provides the option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This feature includes a slider for selecting the step.

119 - How does someone without an account see run results?
==========================================================

If someone runs the script with `anonymous="allow"`:

1. **Auto-create temporary account**: W&B checks for a signed-in account. If none exists, W&B creates a new anonymous account and saves the API key for that session.
2. **Log results quickly**: Users can repeatedly run the script and instantly view results in the W&B dashboard. These unclaimed anonymous runs remain available for 7 days.
3. **Claim data when it’s useful**: Once a user identifies valuable results in W&B, they can click a button in the banner at the top of the page to save their run data to a real account. Without claiming, the run data deletes after 7 days.

**Anonymous run links are sensitive**. These links permit anyone to view and claim experiment results for 7 days, so share links only with trusted individuals. For publicly sharing results while hiding the author’s identity, contact [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com) for assistance.

When a W&B user finds and runs the script, their results log correctly to their account, just like a normal run.

120 - How does wandb stream logs and writes to disk?
====================================================

W&B queues events in memory and writes them to disk asynchronously to manage failures and support the `WANDB_MODE=offline` configuration, allowing synchronization after logging.

In the terminal, observe the path to the local run directory. This directory includes a `.wandb` file, which serves as the datastore. For image logging, W&B stores images in the `media/images` subdirectory before uploading them to cloud storage.

121 - How is W&B different from TensorBoard?
============================================

W&B integrates with TensorBoard and improves experiment tracking tools. The founders created W&B to address common frustrations faced by TensorBoard users. Key improvements include:

1. **Model Reproducibility**: W&B facilitates experimentation, exploration, and model reproduction. It captures metrics, hyperparameters, code versions, and saves model checkpoints to ensure reproducibility.
2. **Automatic Organization**: W&B streamlines project handoffs and vacations by providing an overview of all attempted models, which saves time by preventing the re-execution of old experiments.
3. **Quick Integration**: Integrate W&B into your project in five minutes. Install the free open-source Python package and add a few lines of code. Logged metrics and records appear with each model run.
4. **Centralized Dashboard**: Access a consistent dashboard regardless of where training occurs—locally, on lab clusters, or cloud spot instances. Eliminate the need to manage TensorBoard files across different machines.
5. **Robust Filtering Table**: Search, filter, sort, and group results from various models efficiently. Easily identify the best-performing models for different tasks, an area where TensorBoard often struggles with larger projects.
6. **Collaboration Tools**: W&B enhances collaboration for complex machine learning projects. Share project links and utilize private teams for result sharing. Create reports with interactive visualizations and markdown descriptions for work logs or presentations.

122 - How many runs can I create per project?
=============================================

Limit each project to approximately 10,000 runs for optimal performance.

123 - How much storage does each artifact version use?
======================================================

Only files that change between two artifact versions incur storage costs.

![v1 of the artifact 'dataset' has only 2 out of 5 images that differ, so it occupies only 40% of the space.](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/artifacts/artifacts-dedupe.PNG)

Consider an image artifact named `animals` that contains two image files, `cat.png` and `dog.png`:

```
images
|-- cat.png (2MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- dog.png (1MB) # Added in `v0`

```

This artifact receives version `v0`.

When adding a new image, `rat.png`, a new artifact version, `v1`, is created with the following contents:

```
images
|-- cat.png (2MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- dog.png (1MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- rat.png (3MB) # Added in `v1`

```

Version `v1` tracks a total of 6MB, but occupies only 3MB of space since it shares the remaining 3MB with `v0`. Deleting `v1` reclaims the 3MB of storage associated with `rat.png`. Deleting `v0` transfers the storage costs of `cat.png` and `dog.png` to `v1`, increasing its storage size to 6MB.

124 - How often are system metrics collected?
=============================================

Metrics collect by default every 10 seconds. For higher resolution metrics, email [contact@wandb.com](mailto:contact@wandb.com).

125 - How should I run sweeps on SLURM?
=======================================

When using sweeps with the [SLURM scheduling system](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html), run `wandb agent --count 1 SWEEP_ID` in each scheduled job. This command executes a single training job and then exits, facilitating runtime predictions for resource requests while leveraging the parallelism of hyperparameter searches.

126 - How to get multiple charts with different selected runs?
==============================================================

With W&B Reports, follow these steps:

1. Create multiple panel grids.
2. Apply filters to select the desired run sets for each panel grid.
3. Generate the desired charts within the panel grids.

127 - Hyperparameter
====================

The following support questions are tagged with **Hyperparameter**. If you don’t see
your question answered, try [asking the community](https://community.wandb.ai/),
or email [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com).

* [Best practices to organize hyperparameter searches](/support/best_practices_organize_hyperparameter_searches/)
* [Can I rerun a grid search?](/support/rerun_grid_search/)
* [What is the `Est. Runs` column?](/support/est_runs_column/)

128 - I converted my report to WYSIWYG but want to revert back to Markdown
==========================================================================

If the report conversion occurred through the message at the top, click the red “Revert” button to restore the prior state. Note that any changes made after conversion will be lost.

If a single Markdown block was converted, use `cmd+z` to undo.

If options to revert are unavailable because of a closed session, consider discarding the draft or editing from the last saved version. If neither works, contact W&B Support.

129 - I didn't name my run. Where is the run name coming from?
==============================================================

If a run is not explicitly named, W&B assigns a random name to identify it in your project. Examples of random names are `pleasant-flower-4` and `misunderstood-glade-2.

130 - If I am the admin of my local instance, how should I manage it?
=====================================================================

If you are the admin for your instance, review the [User Management](/guides/hosting/iam/access-management/manage-organization/) section for instructions on adding users and creating teams.

131 - If wandb crashes, will it possibly crash my training run?
===============================================================

It is critical to avoid interference with training runs. W&B operates in a separate process, ensuring that training continues even if W&B experiences a crash. In the event of an internet outage, W&B continually retries sending data to [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai).

132 - Incorporating LaTeX
=========================

LaTeX integrates seamlessly into reports. To add LaTeX, create a new report and begin typing in the rich text area to write notes and save custom visualizations and tables.

On a new line, press `/` and navigate to the inline equations tab to insert LaTeX content.

133 - InitStartError: Error communicating with wandb process
============================================================

This error indicates that the library encounters an issue launching the process that synchronizes data to the server.

The following workarounds resolve the issue in specific environments:

* Linux and OS X
* Google Colab

```
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(start_method="fork"))

```

For versions prior to `0.13.0`, use:

```
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(start_method="thread"))

```

134 - Is it possible to add the same service account to multiple teams?
=======================================================================

A service account cannot be added to multiple teams in W&B. Each service account is tied to a specific team.

135 - Is it possible to change the group assigned to a run after completion?
============================================================================

You can change the group assigned to a completed run using the API. This feature does not appear in the web UI. Use the following code to update the group:

```
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("<ENTITY>/<PROJECT>/<RUN_ID>")
run.group = "NEW-GROUP-NAME"
run.update()

```

136 - Is it possible to change the username?
============================================

Changing the username after account creation is not possible. Create a new account with the desired username instead.

137 - Is it possible to create a new account with an email that was previously used for a deleted account?
==========================================================================================================

A new account can use an email previously associated with a deleted account.

138 - Is it possible to move a run from one project to another?
===============================================================

You can move a run from one project to another by following these steps:

* Navigate to the project page with the run to be moved.
* Click on the **Runs** tab to open the runs table.
* Select the runs to move.
* Click the **Move** button.
* Choose the destination project and confirm the action.

W&B supports moving runs through the UI, but does not support copying runs. Artifacts logged with the runs do not transfer to the new project. To move artifacts to the run’s new location manually, you can use the [`wandb artifact get`](/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-get/) SDK command or the [`Api.artifact` API](/ref/python/public-api/api/#artifact) to download the artifact, then use [wandb artifact put](/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-put/) or the `Api.artifact` API to upload it to the run’s new location.

139 - Is it possible to plot the max of a metric rather than plot step by step?
===============================================================================

Create a scatter plot of the metric. Open the **Edit** menu and select **Annotations**. From there, plot the running maximum of the values.

140 - Is it possible to recover an artifact after it has been deleted with a run?
=================================================================================

When deleting a run, a prompt asks whether to delete the associated artifacts. Choosing this option permanently removes the artifacts, making recovery impossible, even if the run itself is restored later.

141 - Is it possible to save metrics offline and sync them to W&B later?
========================================================================

By default, `wandb.init` starts a process that syncs metrics in real time to the cloud. For offline use, set two environment variables to enable offline mode and sync later.

Set the following environment variables:

1. `WANDB_API_KEY=$KEY`, where `$KEY` is the API Key from your [settings page](https://app.wandb.ai/settings).
2. `WANDB_MODE="offline"`.

Here is an example of implementing this in a script:

```
import wandb
import os

os.environ["WANDB_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
os.environ["WANDB_MODE"] = "offline"

config = {
    "dataset": "CIFAR10",
    "machine": "offline cluster",
    "model": "CNN",
    "learning_rate": 0.01,
    "batch_size": 128,
}

wandb.init(project="offline-demo")

for i in range(100):
    wandb.log({"accuracy": i})

```

Sample terminal output is shown below:

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/experiments/sample_terminal_output.png)

After completing work, run the following command to sync data to the cloud:

```
wandb sync wandb/dryrun-folder-name

```

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/experiments/sample_terminal_output_cloud.png)

142 - Is there a dark mode?
===========================

Dark mode is in beta and not optimized for accessibility. To enable dark mode:

1. Go to your account settings at <https://wandb.ai/settings>.
2. Scroll to the **Public preview features** section.
3. In **UI Display**, select **Dark mode** from the dropdown.

143 - Is there a monthly subscription option for the teams plan?
================================================================

The Teams plan does not offer a monthly subscription option. This subscription is billed annually.

144 - Is there a W&B outage?
============================

Check if the W&B multi-tenant cloud at wandb.ai is experiencing an outage by visiting the W&B status page at <https://status.wandb.com>.

145 - Is there a way to add extra values to a sweep, or do I need to start a new one?
=====================================================================================

Once a W&B Sweep starts, you cannot change the Sweep configuration. However, you can navigate to any table view, select runs using the checkboxes, and then choose the **Create sweep** menu option to generate a new Sweep configuration based on previous runs.

146 - Is there a way to add more seats?
=======================================

To add more seats to an account, follow these steps:

* Contact the Account Executive or support team ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)) for assistance.
* Provide the organization name and the desired number of seats.

147 - Is there an anaconda package for Weights and Biases?
==========================================================

There is an anaconda package that is installable using either `pip` or `conda`. For `conda`, obtain the package from the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) channel.

* pip
* conda

```
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n wandb-env python=3.8 anaconda
# Activate the environment
conda activate wandb-env
# Install wandb using pip
pip install wandb

```

```
conda activate myenv
conda install wandb --channel conda-forge

```

For installation issues, refer to this Anaconda [documentation on managing packages](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html) for assistance.

150 - My report is running slowly after the change to WYSIWYG
=============================================================

Performance issues may arise on older hardware or with very large reports. To mitigate this, collapse sections of the report that are not currently in use.

151 - My report looks different after converting from Markdown.
===============================================================

The goal is to maintain the original appearance after transitioning to WYSIWYG, but the conversion process is not flawless. If significant discrepancies arise, report them for evaluation. Users can revert to the previous state until the editing session concludes.

152 - My run's state is `crashed` on the UI but is still running on my machine. What do I do to get my data back?
=================================================================================================================

You likely lost connection to your machine during training. Recover data by running [`wandb sync [PATH_TO_RUN]`](/ref/cli/wandb-sync/). The path to your run is a folder in your `wandb` directory that matches the Run ID of the ongoing run.

153 - Notebooks
===============

* [How do I handle the ‘Failed to query for notebook’ error?](/support/query_notebook_failed/)
* [How do I silence W&B info messages?](/support/silence_info_messages/)

154 - On a local instance, which files should I check when I have issues?
=========================================================================

Check the `Debug Bundle`. An admin can retrieve it from the `/system-admin` page by selecting the W&B icon in the top right corner and then choosing `Debug Bundle`.

![Access System settings page as an Admin of a local instance](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/technical_faq/local_system_settings.png)
![Download the Debug Bundle as an Admin of a local instance](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/technical_faq/debug_bundle.png)

155 - Optimizing multiple metrics
=================================

To optimize multiple metrics in a single run, use a weighted sum of the individual metrics.

```
metric_combined = 0.3 * metric_a + 0.2 * metric_b + ... + 1.5 * metric_n
wandb.log({"metric_combined": metric_combined})

```

Log the new combined metric and set it as the optimization objective:

```
metric:
  name: metric_combined
  goal: minimize

```

173 - Using artifacts with multiple architectures and runs?
===========================================================

There are various methods to version a model. Artifacts provide a tool for model versioning tailored to specific needs. A common approach for projects that explore multiple model architectures involves separating artifacts by architecture. Consider the following steps:

1. Create a new artifact for each distinct model architecture. Use the `metadata` attribute of artifacts to provide detailed descriptions of the architecture, similar to the use of `config` for a run.
2. For each model, log checkpoints periodically with `log_artifact`. W&B builds a history of these checkpoints, labeling the most recent one with the `latest` alias. Refer to the latest checkpoint for any model architecture using `architecture-name:latest`.

174 - What are features that are not available to anonymous users?
==================================================================

* **No persistent data**: Runs save for 7 days in an anonymous account. Claim anonymous run data by saving it to a real account.

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/app_ui/anon_mode_no_data.png)

* **No artifact logging**: A warning appears on the command line when attempting to log an artifact to an anonymous run:

  ```
  wandb: WARNING Artifacts logged anonymously cannot be claimed and expire after 7 days.

  ```
* **No profile or settings pages**: The UI does not include certain pages, as they are only useful for real accounts.

175 - What does wandb.init do to my training process?
=====================================================

When `wandb.init()` runs in a training script, an API call creates a run object on the servers. A new process starts to stream and collect metrics, allowing the primary process to function normally. The script writes to local files while the separate process streams data to the servers, including system metrics. To turn off streaming, run `wandb off` from the training directory or set the `WANDB_MODE` environment variable to `offline`.

176 - What formula do you use for your smoothing algorithm?
===========================================================

The exponential moving average formula aligns with the one used in TensorBoard.

Refer to this [explanation on Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42281844/what-is-the-mathematics-behind-the-smoothing-parameter-in-tensorboards-scalar/75421930#75421930) for details on the equivalent Python implementation. The source code to TensorBoard’s smoothing algorithm (as of this writing) can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/34877f15153e1a2087316b9952c931807a122aa7/tensorboard/components/vz_line_chart2/line-chart.ts#L699).

177 - What happens if I edit my Python files while a sweep is running?
======================================================================

While a sweep is running:

* If the `train.py` script which the sweep uses changes, the sweep continues to use the original `train.py`
* If files that the `train.py` script references change, such as helper functions in the `helper.py` script, the sweep begins to use the updated `helper.py`.

178 - What happens if I pass a class attribute into wandb.log()?
================================================================

Avoid passing class attributes into `wandb.log()`. Attributes may change before the network call executes. When storing metrics as class attributes, use a deep copy to ensure the logged metric matches the attribute’s value at the time of the `wandb.log()` call.

179 - What happens if internet connection is lost while I'm training a model?
=============================================================================

If the library cannot connect to the internet, it enters a retry loop and continues to attempt to stream metrics until the network is restored. The program continues to run during this time.

To run on a machine without internet, set `WANDB_MODE=offline`. This configuration stores metrics locally on the hard drive. Later, call `wandb sync DIRECTORY` to stream the data to the server.

180 - What happens when I log millions of steps to W&B? How is that rendered in the browser?
============================================================================================

The number of points sent affects the loading time of graphs in the UI. For lines exceeding 1,000 points, the backend samples the data down to 1,000 points before sending it to the browser. This sampling is nondeterministic, resulting in different sampled points upon page refresh.

Log fewer than 10,000 points per metric. Logging over 1 million points in a line significantly increases page load time. Explore strategies to minimize logging footprint without sacrificing accuracy in this [Colab](http://wandb.me/log-hf-colab). With more than 500 columns of config and summary metrics, only 500 display in the table.

181 - What if I want to integrate W&B into my project, but I don't want to upload any images or media?
======================================================================================================

W&B supports projects that log only scalars by allowing explicit specification of files or data for upload. Refer to this [example in PyTorch](http://wandb.me/pytorch-colab) that demonstrates logging without using images.

182 - What if I want to log some metrics on batches and some metrics only on epochs?
====================================================================================

To log specific metrics in each batch and standardize plots, log the desired x-axis values alongside the metrics. In the custom plots, click edit and select a custom x-axis.

```
wandb.log({"batch": batch_idx, "loss": 0.3})
wandb.log({"epoch": epoch, "val_acc": 0.94})

```

183 - What is a service account, and why is it useful?
======================================================

A service account (Enterprise-only feature) represents a non-human or machine user, which can automate common tasks across teams and projects or ones that are not specific to a particular human user. You can create a service account within a team and use its API key to read from and write to projects within that team.

Among other things, service accounts are useful for tracking automated jobs logged to wandb, like periodic retraining, nightly builds, and so on. If you’d like, you can associate a username with one of these machine-launched runs with the [environment variables](/guides/track/environment-variables/) `WANDB_USERNAME` or `WANDB_USER_EMAIL`.

Refer to [Team Service Account Behavior](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/#team-service-account-behavior) for more information.

You can get the API key for a service account in your team at `<WANDB_HOST_URL>/<your-team-name>/service-accounts`. Alternatively you can go to the **Team settings** for your team and then refer to the **Service Accounts** tab.

To create a new service account for your team:

* Press the **+ New service account** button in the **Service Accounts** tab of your team
* Provide a name in the **Name** field
* Select **Generate API key (Built-in)** as the authentication method
* Press the **Create** button
* Click the **Copy API key** button for the newly created service account and store it in a secret manager or another safe but accessible location

Apart from the **Built-in** service accounts, W&B also supports **External service accounts** using [identity federation for SDK and CLI](/guides/hosting/iam/identity_federation/#external-service-accounts). Use external service accounts if you are looking to automate W&B tasks using service identities managed in your identity provider that can issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

184 - What is a team and where can I find more information about it?
====================================================================

For additional information about teams, visit the [teams section](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/).

185 - What is the `Est. Runs` column?
=====================================

W&B provides an estimated number of Runs generated when creating a W&B Sweep with a discrete search space. This total reflects the cartesian product of the search space.

For instance, consider the following search space:

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/sweeps/sweeps_faq_whatisestruns_1.png)

In this case, the Cartesian product equals 9. W&B displays this value in the App UI as the estimated run count (**Est. Runs**):

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/sweeps/spaces_sweeps_faq_whatisestruns_2.webp)

To retrieve the estimated Run count programmatically, use the `expected_run_count` attribute of the Sweep object within the W&B SDK:

```
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(
    sweep_configs, project="your_project_name", entity="your_entity_name"
)
api = wandb.Api()
sweep = api.sweep(f"your_entity_name/your_project_name/sweeps/{sweep_id}")
print(f"EXPECTED RUN COUNT = {sweep.expected_run_count}")

```

186 - What is the difference between `.log()` and `.summary`?
=============================================================

The summary displays in the table, while the log saves all values for future plotting.

For instance, call `wandb.log` whenever accuracy changes. By default, `wandb.log()` updates the summary value unless set manually for that metric.

The scatterplot and parallel coordinate plots use the summary value, while the line plot shows all values recorded by `.log`.

Some users prefer to set the summary manually to reflect the optimal accuracy instead of the most recent accuracy logged.

187 - What is the difference between team and entity? As a user - what does entity mean for me?
===============================================================================================

A team serves as a collaborative workspace for users working on the same projects. An entity represents either a username or a team name. When logging runs in W&B, set the entity to a personal or team account using `wandb.init(entity="example-team")`.

188 - What is the difference between team and organization?
===========================================================

A team serves as a collaborative workspace for users working on the same projects. An organization functions as a higher-level entity that can include multiple teams, often related to billing and account management.

189 - What is the difference between wandb.init modes?
======================================================

These modes are available:

* `online` (default): The client sends data to the wandb server.
* `offline`: The client stores data locally on the machine instead of sending it to the wandb server. Use the [`wandb sync`](/ref/cli/wandb-sync/) command to synchronize the data later.
* `disabled`: The client simulates operation by returning mocked objects and prevents any network communication. All logging is turned off, but all API method stubs remain callable. This mode is typically used for testing.

190 - What really good functionalities are hidden and where can I find those?
=============================================================================

Some functionalities are hidden under a feature flag in the **Beta Features** section of a team’s settings.

![Available beta features hidden under a feature flag](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/technical_faq/beta_features.png)

191 - What type of roles are available and what are the differences between them?
=================================================================================

Visit [this](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/#team-roles-and-permissions) page for an overview of the available roles and permissions.

192 - When should I log to my personal entity against my team entity?
=====================================================================

Personal Entities are unavailable for accounts created after May 21, 2024. W&B encourages all users to log new projects to a Team to enable sharing of results.

193 - Where are artifacts downloaded, and how can I control that?
=================================================================

By default, artifacts download to the `artifacts/` folder. To change the location:

* Pass it to [`wandb.Artifact().download`](/ref/python/public-api/api/):

  ```
  wandb.Artifact().download(root="<path_to_download>")

  ```
* Set the `WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR` [environment variable](/guides/track/environment-variables/):

  ```
  import os
  os.environ["WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR"] = "<path_to_download>"

  ```

194 - Which files should I check when my code crashes?
======================================================

For the affected run, check `debug.log` and `debug-internal.log` in `wandb/run-<date>_<time>-<run-id>/logs` in the directory where your code is running.

195 - Who can create a team? Who can add or delete people from a team? Who can delete projects?
===============================================================================================

Refer to the link for details on roles and permissions: [Team Roles and Permissions](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/#team-roles-and-permissions).

196 - Who can edit and share reports?
=====================================

Reports created within an individual’s private project remain visible only to that user. The user can share their project with a team or the public.

In team projects, the administrator or the member who created the report can toggle permissions between edit and view access for other team members. Team members can share reports.

To share a report, select the **Share** button in the upper right corner. Provide an email address or copy the magic link. Users invited by email must log into W&B to view the report, while users with a magic link do not need to log in.

Shared reports maintain view-only access.

197 - Who has access to my artifacts?
=====================================

Artifacts inherit access permissions from their parent project:

* In a private project, only team members can access artifacts.
* In a public project, all users can read artifacts, while only team members can create or modify them.
* In an open project, all users can read and write artifacts.

Artifacts Workflows
-------------------

This section outlines workflows for managing and editing Artifacts. Many workflows utilize [the W&B API](/guides/track/public-api-guide/), a component of [the client library](/ref/python/) that provides access to W&B-stored data.

198 - Why am I seeing fewer data points than I logged?
======================================================

When visualizing metrics against an X-axis other than `Step`, expect to see fewer data points. Metrics must log at the same `Step` to remain synchronized. Only metrics logged at the same `Step` are sampled while interpolating between samples.

**Guidelines**

Bundle metrics into a single `log()` call. For example, instead of:

```
wandb.log({"Precision": precision})
...
wandb.log({"Recall": recall})

```

Use:

```
wandb.log({"Precision": precision, "Recall": recall})

```

For manual control over the step parameter, synchronize metrics in the code as follows:

```
wandb.log({"Precision": precision}, step=step)
...
wandb.log({"Recall": recall}, step=step)

```

Ensure the `step` value remains the same in both `log()` calls for the metrics to log under the same step and sample together. The `step` value must increase monotonically in each call. Otherwise, the `step` value is ignored.

199 - Why are steps missing from a CSV metric export?
=====================================================

Export limits can prevent the entire run history from being exported as a CSV or using the `run.history` API. To access the complete run history, download the run history artifact using Parquet format:

```
import wandb
import pandas as pd

run = wandb.init()
artifact = run.use_artifact('<entity>/<project>/<run-id>-history:v0', type='wandb-history')
artifact_dir = artifact.download()
df = pd.read_parquet('<path to .parquet file>')

```

200 - Why does the storage meter not update after deleting runs?
================================================================

* The storage meter does not update immediately after deleting runs due to processing delays.
* The backend system requires time to synchronize and reflect changes in usage accurately.
* If the storage meter has not updated, wait for the changes to process.

201 - Why is a run marked crashed in W&B when it’s training fine locally?
=========================================================================

This indicates a connection problem. If the server loses internet access and data stops syncing to W&B, the system marks the run as crashed after a brief retry period.

202 - Why is nothing showing up in my graphs?
=============================================

If the message “No visualization data logged yet” appears, the script has not executed the first `wandb.log` call. This situation may occur if the run takes a long time to complete a step. To expedite data logging, log multiple times per epoch instead of only at the end.

203 - Why is the same metric appearing more than once?
======================================================

When logging various data types under the same key, split them in the database. This results in multiple entries of the same metric name in the UI dropdown. The data types grouped are `number`, `string`, `bool`, `other` (primarily arrays), and any `wandb` data type such as `Histogram` or `Image`. Send only one type per key to prevent this issue.

Metric names are case-insensitive. Avoid using names that differ only by case, such as `"My-Metric"` and `"my-metric"`.

204 - Will wandb slow down my training?
=======================================

W&B has a minimal impact on training performance under normal usage conditions. Normal use includes logging at a rate of less than once per second and limiting data to a few megabytes per step. W&B operates in a separate process with non-blocking function calls, ensuring that brief network outages or intermittent disk read/write issues do not disrupt performance. Excessive logging of large amounts of data may lead to disk I/O issues. For further inquiries, contact support.

8 - Best practices to organize hyperparameter searches
======================================================

Set unique tags with `wandb.init(tags='your_tag')`. This allows efficient filtering of project runs by selecting the corresponding tag in a Project Page’s Runs Table.

For more information on wandb.int, see the [documentation](/ref/python/init/).

9 - Billing

* [How do we update our payment method?](/support/update_payment_method/)
* [Is there a monthly subscription option for the teams plan?](/support/monthly_subscription_option_teams_plan/)

10 - Can I get an academic plan as a student?
=============================================

Students can apply for an academic plan by following these steps:

* Visit [the Pricing page on the wandb.com](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing).
* Apply for the academic plan.
* Alternatively, start with a 30-day trial and convert it to an academic plan by visiting <https://wandb.ai/academic_application>.

11 - Can I group runs without using the "Group" feature?
========================================================

Yes, you can also use tags or custom metadata to categorize runs. That can be done using the `Group` button which is available in the Workspace and Runs views of the project.

12 - Can I just log metrics, no code or dataset examples?
=========================================================

By default, W&B does not log dataset examples. By default, W&B logs code and system metrics.

Two methods exist to turn off code logging with environment variables:

1. Set `WANDB_DISABLE_CODE` to `true` to turn off all code tracking. This action prevents retrieval of the git SHA and the diff patch.
2. Set `WANDB_IGNORE_GLOBS` to `*.patch` to stop syncing the diff patch to the servers, while keeping it available locally for application with `wandb restore`.

As an administrator, you can also turn off code saving for your team in your team’s settings:

1. Navigate to the settings of your team at `https://wandb.ai/<team>/settings`. Where `<team>` is the name of your team.
2. Scroll to the Privacy section.
3. Toggle **Enable code saving by default**.

13 - Can I just set the run name to the run ID?
===============================================

Yes. To overwrite the run name with the run ID, use the following code snippet:

```
import wandb

wandb.init()
wandb.run.name = wandb.run.id
wandb.run.save()

```

14 - Can I log metrics on two different time scales?
====================================================

For example, I want to log training accuracy per batch and validation accuracy per epoch.

Yes, log indices like `batch` and `epoch` alongside your metrics. Use `wandb.log({'train_accuracy': 0.9, 'batch': 200})` in one step and `wandb.log({'val_accuracy': 0.8, 'epoch': 4})` in another. In the UI, set the desired value as the x-axis for each chart. To set a default x-axis for a specific index, use [Run.define\_metric()](/ref/python/run/#define_metric). For the example provided, use the following code:

```
wandb.init()

wandb.define_metric("batch")
wandb.define_metric("epoch")

wandb.define_metric("train_accuracy", step_metric="batch")
wandb.define_metric("val_accuracy", step_metric="epoch")

```

15 - Can I rerun a grid search?
===============================

If a grid search completes but some W&B Runs need re-execution due to crashes, delete the specific W&B Runs to re-run. Then, select the **Resume** button on the [sweep control page](/guides/sweeps/sweeps-ui/). Start new W&B Sweep agents using the new Sweep ID.

W&B Run parameter combinations that completed are not re-executed.

16 - Can I run wandb offline?
=============================

If training occurs on an offline machine, use the following steps to upload results to the servers:

1. Set the environment variable `WANDB_MODE=offline` to save metrics locally without an internet connection.
2. When ready to upload, run `wandb init` in your directory to set the project name.
3. Use `wandb sync YOUR_RUN_DIRECTORY` to transfer metrics to the cloud service and access results in the hosted web app.

To confirm the run is offline, check `run.settings._offline` or `run.settings.mode` after executing `wandb.init()`.

17 - Can I turn off wandb when testing my code?
===============================================

Use `wandb.init(mode="disabled")` or set `WANDB_MODE=disabled` to configure W&B as a no-operation (NOOP) for testing purposes.

Using `wandb.init(mode="disabled")` does not prevent W&B from saving artifacts to `WANDB_CACHE_DIR`.

18 - Can I use Markdown in my reports?
======================================

Yes. Type “/mark” anywhere in the document and press enter to insert a Markdown block. This allows editing with Markdown as before.

19 - Can I use Sweeps and SageMaker?
====================================

To authenticate W&B, complete the following steps: create a `requirements.txt` file if using a built-in Amazon SageMaker estimator. For details on authentication and setting up the `requirements.txt` file, refer to the [SageMaker integration](/guides/integrations/sagemaker/) guide.

Find a complete example on [GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/examples/tree/master/examples/pytorch/pytorch-cifar10-sagemaker) and additional insights on our [blog](https://wandb.ai/site/articles/running-sweeps-with-sagemaker).  
Access the [tutorial](https://wandb.ai/authors/sagemaker/reports/Deploy-Sentiment-Analyzer-Using-SageMaker-and-W-B--VmlldzoxODA1ODE) for deploying a sentiment analyzer using SageMaker and W&B.

20 - Can W&B team members see my data?
======================================

Key engineers and support staff at W&B access logged values for debugging purposes with user permission. All data stores encrypt data at rest, and audit logs record access. For complete data security from W&B employees, license the self-hosted solution to run a W&B server within your own infrastructure.

21 - Can we flag boolean variables as hyperparameters?
======================================================

Use the `${args_no_boolean_flags}` macro in the command section of the configuration to pass hyperparameters as boolean flags. This macro automatically includes boolean parameters as flags. If `param` is `True`, the command receives `--param`. If `param` is `False`, the flag is omitted.

22 - Can you group runs by tags?
================================

A run can have multiple tags, so grouping by tags is not supported. Add a value to the [`config`](/guides/track/config/) object for these runs and group by this config value instead. This can be accomplished using [the API](/guides/track/config/#set-the-configuration-after-your-run-has-finished).

23 - Can you use W&B Sweeps with cloud infrastructures such as AWS Batch, ECS, etc.?
====================================================================================

To publish the `sweep_id` so that any W&B Sweep agent can access it, implement a method for these agents to read and execute the `sweep_id`.

For example, launch an Amazon EC2 instance and execute `wandb agent` on it. Use an SQS queue to broadcast the `sweep_id` to multiple EC2 instances. Each instance can then retrieve the `sweep_id` from the queue and initiate the process.

26 - Crashing And Hanging Runs
==============================

The following support questions are tagged with **Crashing And Hanging Runs**. If you don’t see
your question answered, try [asking the community](https://community.wandb.ai/),
or email [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com).

* [How can I fix the error `AttributeError: module 'wandb' has no attribute ...`?](/support/how_can_i_resolve_the_attributeerror_module_wandb_has_no_attribute/)

* [Why is a run marked crashed in W&B when it’s training fine locally?](/support/run_marked_crashed_wbs_training_fine_locally/)

27 - Do "Run Finished" alerts work in notebooks?
================================================

No. **Run Finished** alerts (activated with the **Run Finished** setting in User Settings) operate only with Python scripts and remain turned off in Jupyter Notebook environments to avoid notifications for each cell execution.

Use `wandb.alert()` in notebook environments instead.

28 - Do environment variables overwrite the parameters passed to wandb.init()?
==============================================================================

Arguments passed to `wandb.init` override environment variables. To set a default directory other than the system default when the environment variable isn’t set, use `wandb.init(dir=os.getenv("WANDB_DIR", my_default_override))`.

29 - Do I need to provide values for all hyperparameters as part of the W&B Sweep. Can I set defaults?
======================================================================================================

Access hyperparameter names and values from the sweep configuration using `wandb.config`, which acts like a dictionary.

For runs outside a sweep, set `wandb.config` values by passing a dictionary to the `config` argument in `wandb.init`. In a sweep, any configuration supplied to `wandb.init` serves as a default value, which the sweep can override.

Use `config.setdefaults` for explicit behavior. The following code snippets illustrate both methods:

* wandb.init()
* config.setdefaults()

```
# Set default values for hyperparameters
config_defaults = {"lr": 0.1, "batch_size": 256}

# Start a run and provide defaults
# that a sweep can override
with wandb.init(config=config_defaults) as run:
    # Add training code here
    ...

```

```
# Set default values for hyperparameters
config_defaults = {"lr": 0.1, "batch_size": 256}

# Start a run
with wandb.init() as run:
    # Update any values not set by the sweep
    run.config.setdefaults(config_defaults)

    # Add training code here

```

30 - Do you have a bug bounty program?
======================================

Weights and Biases has a bug bounty program. Access the security portal for details: <https://security.wandb.ai/>.

31 - Does logging block my training?
====================================

“Is the logging function lazy? I don’t want to depend on the network to send results to your servers while executing local operations.”

The `wandb.log` function writes a line to a local file and does not block network calls. When calling `wandb.init`, a new process starts on the same machine. This process listens for filesystem changes and communicates with the web service asynchronously, allowing local operations to continue uninterrupted.

32 - Does the W&B client support Python 2?
==========================================

The W&B client library supported both Python 2.7 and Python 3 through version 0.10. Support for Python 2.7 discontinued with version 0.11 due to Python 2’s end of life. Running `pip install --upgrade wandb` on a Python 2.7 system installs only new releases of the 0.10.x series. Support for the 0.10.x series includes critical bug fixes and patches only. The last version of the 0.10.x series that supports Python 2.7 is 0.10.33.

33 - Does the W&B client support Python 3.5?
============================================

The W&B client library supported Python 3.5 until version 0.11. Support for Python 3.5 ended with version 0.12, which aligns with its end of life. For more details, visit [version 0.12 release notes](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/releases/tag/v0.12.0).

34 - Does this only work for Python?
====================================

The library supports Python 2.7 and later, as well as Python 3.6 and later. The architecture facilitates integration with other programming languages. For monitoring other languages, contact [contact@wandb.com](mailto:contact@wandb.com).

35 - Does W&B support SSO for Multi-tenant?
===========================================

W&B supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for the Multi-tenant offering through Auth0. SSO integration is compatible with any OIDC-compliant identity provider, such as Okta or Azure AD. To configure an OIDC provider, follow these steps:

* Create a Single Page Application (SPA) on the identity provider.
* Set the `grant_type` to `implicit` flow.
* Set the callback URI to `https://wandb.auth0.com/login/callback`.

**Requirements for W&B**

After completing the setup, contact the customer success manager (CSM) with the `Client ID` and `Issuer URL` for the application. W&B will establish an Auth0 connection using these details and enable SSO.

36 - Does W&B use the `multiprocessing` library?
================================================

Yes, W&B uses the `multiprocessing` library. An error message like the following indicates a possible issue:

```
An attempt has been made to start a new process before the current process 
has finished its bootstrapping phase.

```

To resolve this, add an entry point protection with `if __name__ == "__main__":`. This protection is necessary when running W&B directly from the script.

37 - Does your tool track or store training data?
=================================================

Pass a SHA or unique identifier to `wandb.config.update(...)` to associate a dataset with a training run. W&B stores no data unless `wandb.save` is called with the local file name.

38 - Embedding Reports
======================

You can share your report by embedding it. Click the **Share** button at the top right of your report, then copy the embedded code from the bottom of the pop-up window.

41 - Filter and delete unwanted reports
=======================================

Use the search bar to filter the reports list. Select an unwanted report to delete it individually, or select all reports and click ‘Delete Reports’ to remove them from the project.

![Delete unwanted reports and drafts](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/reports/delete_runs.gif)

42 - How can I access the data logged to my runs directly and programmatically?
===============================================================================

The history object tracks metrics logged with `wandb.log`. Access the history object using the API:

```
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("username/project/run_id")
print(run.history())

```

43 - How can I be removed from a team?
======================================

A team admin can [remove you from a team](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/) from the **Users** tab of the team settings.

44 - How can I change how frequently to log system metrics?
===========================================================

To configure the frequency to log [system metrics](/guides/models/app/settings-page/system-metrics/), set `_stats_sampling_interval` to a number of seconds, expressed as a float. Default: `10.0`.

```
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(x_stats_sampling_interval=30.0))

```

45 - How can I change my account from corporate to academic?
============================================================

To change an account from corporate to academic in Weights & Biases, follow these steps:

1. **Link your academic email**:

   * Access account settings.
   * Add and set the academic email as the primary email.
2. **Apply for an academic plan**:

   * Visit the academic application page at <https://wandb.ai/academic_application>.
   * Submit the application for review.

46 - How can I change the colors of each run in the same group?
===============================================================

Changing the colors of individual runs within a group is not possible. All runs in the same group share a common color.

47 - How can I change the directory my sweep logs to locally?
=============================================================

Set the logging directory for W&B run data by configuring the environment variable `WANDB_DIR`. For example:

```
os.environ["WANDB_DIR"] = os.path.abspath("your/directory")

```

48 - How can I compare images or media across epochs or steps?
==============================================================

Expand the image panel and use the step slider to navigate through images from different steps. This process facilitates comparison of a model’s output changes during training.

49 - How can I configure the name of the run in my training code?
=================================================================

At the beginning of the training script, call `wandb.init` with an experiment name. For example: `wandb.init(name="my_awesome_run")`.

50 - How can I define the local location for `wandb` files?
===========================================================

* `WANDB_DIR=<path>` or `wandb.init(dir=<path>)`: Controls the location of the `wandb` folder created for your training script. Defaults to `./wandb`. This folder stores Run’s data and logs
* `WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR=<path>` or `wandb.Artifact().download(root="<path>")`: Controls the location where artifacts are downloaded. Defaults to `./artifacts`
* `WANDB_CACHE_DIR=<path>`: This is the location where artifacts are created and stored when you call `wandb.Artifact`. Defaults to `~/.cache/wandb`
* `WANDB_CONFIG_DIR=<path>`: Where config files are stored. Defaults to `~/.config/wandb`
* `WANDB_DATA_DIR=<PATH>`: Controls the location used for staging artifacts during upload. Defaults to `~/.cache/wandb-data/`.

51 - How can I delete multiple runs in bulk instead of one at a time?
=====================================================================

Use the [public API](/ref/python/public-api/api/) to delete multiple runs in a single operation:

```
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()
runs = api.runs('<entity>/<project>')
for run in runs:
    if <condition>:
        run.delete()

```

52 - How can I delete my user account?
======================================

Delete your user account by clicking **Delete account** in your [user settings](/guides/models/app/settings-page/user-settings/#delete-your-account). Note that this action is irreversible and it takes effect immediately.

53 - How can I disable logging of system metrics to W&B?
========================================================

To disable logging of [system metrics](/guides/models/app/settings-page/system-metrics/), set `_disable_stats` to `True`:

```
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(x_disable_stats=True))

```

54 - How can I fetch these Version IDs and ETags in W&B?
========================================================

If an artifact reference is logged with W&B and versioning is enabled on the buckets, the version IDs appear in the Amazon S3 UI. To retrieve these version IDs and ETags in W&B, fetch the artifact and access the corresponding manifest entries. For example:

```
artifact = run.use_artifact("my_table:latest")
for entry in artifact.manifest.entries.values():
    versionID = entry.extra.get("versionID")
    etag = entry.extra.get("etag")

```

55 - How can I find the artifacts logged or consumed by a run? How can I find the runs that produced or consumed an artifact?
=============================================================================================================================

W&B tracks artifacts logged by each run and those used by each run to construct an artifact graph. This graph is a bipartite, directed, acyclic graph with nodes representing runs and artifacts. An example can be viewed [here](https://wandb.ai/shawn/detectron2-11/artifacts/dataset/furniture-small-val/06d5ddd4deeb2a6ebdd5/graph) (click “Explode” to expand the graph).

Use the Public API to navigate the graph programmatically, starting from either an artifact or a run.

* From an Artifact
* From a Run

```
api = wandb.Api()

artifact = api.artifact("project/artifact:alias")

# Walk up the graph from an artifact:
producer_run = artifact.logged_by()
# Walk down the graph from an artifact:
consumer_runs = artifact.used_by()

# Walk down the graph from a run:
next_artifacts = consumer_runs[0].logged_artifacts()
# Walk up the graph from a run:
previous_artifacts = producer_run.used_artifacts()

```

```
api = wandb.Api()

run = api.run("entity/project/run_id")

# Walk down the graph from a run:
produced_artifacts = run.logged_artifacts()
# Walk up the graph from a run:
consumed_artifacts = run.used_artifacts()

# Walk up the graph from an artifact:
earlier_run = consumed_artifacts[0].logged_by()
# Walk down the graph from an artifact:
consumer_runs = produced_artifacts[0].used_by()

```

56 - How can I fix an error like `AttributeError: module 'wandb' has no attribute ...`?
=======================================================================================

If you encounter an error like `AttributeError: module 'wandb' has no attribute 'init'` or `AttributeError: module 'wandb' has no attribute 'login'` when importing `wandb` in Python, `wandb` is not installed or the installation is corrupted, but a `wandb` directory exists in the current working directory. To fix this error, uninstall `wandb`, delete the directory, then install `wandb`:

```
pip uninstall wandb; rm -rI wandb; pip install wandb

```

57 - How can I log a metric that doesn't change over time such as a final evaluation accuracy?
==============================================================================================

Using `wandb.log({'final_accuracy': 0.9})` updates the final accuracy correctly. By default, `wandb.log({'final_accuracy': <value>})` updates `wandb.settings['final_accuracy']`, which reflects the value in the runs table.

58 - How can I log additional metrics after a run completes?
============================================================

There are several ways to manage experiments.

For complex workflows, use multiple runs and set the group parameters in [`wandb.init`](/guides/track/launch/) to a unique value for all processes within a single experiment. The [**Runs** tab](/guides/track/project-page/#runs-tab) will group the table by group ID, ensuring that visualizations function properly. This approach enables concurrent experiments and training runs while logging results in one location.

For simpler workflows, call `wandb.init` with `resume=True` and `id=UNIQUE_ID`, then call `wandb.init` again with the same `id=UNIQUE_ID`. Log normally with [`wandb.log`](/guides/track/log/) or `wandb.summary`, and the run values will update accordingly.

59 - How can I log in to W&B Server?
====================================

Set the login URL by either of these methods:

* Set the [environment variable](/guides/track/environment-variables/) `WANDB_BASE_URL` to the Server URL.
* Set the `--host` flag of [`wandb login`](/ref/cli/wandb-login/) to the Server URL.

60 - How can I make my project public?
======================================

To make a project public, follow these steps:

1. Access the project page in the Weights & Biases web app.
2. Click the lock icon in the navigation bar to open privacy settings.
3. Choose “Public” to allow visibility for anyone.
4. Save the changes.

If the “Public” option is not available due to restrictions, consider the following options:

* Share a view-only link via a report.
* Contact the organization’s admin for assistance.
* Check account settings to confirm permission for public projects.

61 - How can I organize my logged charts and media in the W&B UI?
=================================================================

The `/` character separates logged panels in the W&B UI. By default, the segment of the logged item’s name before the `/` defines a group of panels known as a “Panel Section.”

```
wandb.log({"val/loss": 1.1, "val/acc": 0.3})
wandb.log({"train/loss": 0.1, "train/acc": 0.94})

```

In the [Workspace](/guides/track/project-page/#workspace-tab) settings, adjust the grouping of panels based on either the first segment or all segments separated by `/`.

62 - How can I overwrite the logs from previous steps?
======================================================

To overwrite logs from previous steps, use [forking](/guides/runs/forking/) and [rewind](/guides/runs/rewind/).

63 - How can I recover deleted runs?
====================================

To recover deleted runs, complete the following steps:

* Navigate to the Project Overview page.
* Click the three dots in the top right corner.
* Select **Undelete recently deleted runs**.

**Notes**:

* You can only restore runs deleted within the last 7 days.
* You can manually upload logs using the W&B API if undelete is not an option.

64 - How can I regain access to my account if I cannot receive a password reset email?
======================================================================================

To regain access to an account when unable to receive a password reset email:

1. **Check Spam or Junk Folders:** Ensure the email is not filtered there.
2. **Verify Email:** Confirm the correct email associated with the account.
3. **Check for SSO Options:** Use services like “Sign in with Google” if available.
4. **Contact Support:** If issues persist, reach out to support ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)) and provide your username and email for assistance.

65 - How can I remove projects from a team space without admin privileges?
==========================================================================

To remove projects from a team space without admin privileges, follow these options:

* Request that a current admin remove the projects.
* Ask the admin to grant temporary access for project management.

If unable to contact the admin, reach out to a billing admin or another authorized user in your organization for assistance.

66 - How can I resolve login issues with my account?
====================================================

To resolve login issues, follow these steps:

* **Verify access**: Confirm you are using the correct email or username and check membership in relevant teams or projects.
* **Browser troubleshooting**:
  + Use an incognito window to avoid cached data interference.
  + Clear the browser cache.
  + Attempt to log in from a different browser or device.
* **SSO and permissions**:
  + Verify the identity provider (IdP) and Single Sign-On (SSO) settings.
  + If using SSO, confirm inclusion in the appropriate SSO group.
* **Technical problems**:
  + Take note of specific error messages for further troubleshooting.
  + Contact the support team for additional assistance if issues persist.

67 - How can I resolve the Filestream rate limit exceeded error?
================================================================

To resolve the “Filestream rate limit exceeded” error in Weights & Biases (W&B), follow these steps:

**Optimize logging**:

* Reduce logging frequency or batch logs to decrease API requests.
* Stagger experiment start times to avoid simultaneous API requests.

**Check for outages**:

* Verify that the issue does not arise from a temporary server-side problem by checking [W&B status updates](https://status.wandb.com).

**Contact support**:

* Reach out to W&B support ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)) with details of the experimental setup to request an increase in rate limits.

68 - How can I resume a sweep using Python code?
================================================

To resume a sweep, pass the `sweep_id` to the `wandb.agent()` function.

```
import wandb

sweep_id = "your_sweep_id"

def train():
    # Training code here
    pass

wandb.agent(sweep_id=sweep_id, function=train)

```

69 - How can I rotate or revoke access?
=======================================

Personal and service account keys can be rotated or revoked. Create a new API key or service account user, then reconfigure scripts to use the new key. After reconfiguration, remove the old API key from your profile or team.

70 - How can I save the git commit associated with my run?
==========================================================

When `wandb.init` is invoked, the system automatically collects git information, including the remote repository link and the SHA of the latest commit. This information appears on the [run page](/guides/runs/#view-logged-runs). Ensure the current working directory when executing the script is within a git-managed folder to view this information.

The git commit and the command used to run the experiment remain visible to the user but are hidden from external users. In public projects, these details remain private.

71 - How can I see files that do not appear in the Files tab?
=============================================================

The Files tab shows a maximum of 10,000 files. To download all files, use the [public API](/ref/python/public-api/api/):

```
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run('<entity>/<project>/<run_id>')
run.file('<file>').download()

for f in run.files():
    if <condition>:
        f.download()

```

72 - How can I see the bytes stored, bytes tracked and tracked hours of my organization?
========================================================================================

View the bytes stored, bytes tracked, and tracked hours for your organization within organization settings:

1. Navigate to your organization’s settings at `https://wandb.ai/account-settings/<organization-name>/settings`.
2. Select the **Billing** tab.
3. Within the **Usage this billing period** section, select **View usage** button.

Ensure to replace values enclosed in `<>` with your organization’s name.

73 - How can I send run alerts to Microsoft Teams?
==================================================

To receive W&B alerts in Teams, follow these steps:

* **Set up an email address for your Teams channel.** Create an email address for the Teams channel where you want to receive alerts.
* **Forward W&B alert emails to the Teams channel’s email address.** Configure W&B to send alerts via email, then forward these emails to your Teams channel’s email.

74 - How can I use wandb with multiprocessing, e.g. distributed training?
=========================================================================

If a training program uses multiple processes, structure the program to avoid making wandb method calls from processes without `wandb.init()`.

Manage multiprocess training using these approaches:

1. Call `wandb.init` in all processes and use the [group](/guides/runs/grouping/) keyword argument to create a shared group. Each process will have its own wandb run, and the UI will group the training processes together.
2. Call `wandb.init` from only one process and pass data to log through [multiprocessing queues](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#exchanging-objects-between-processes).

Refer to the [Distributed Training Guide](/guides/track/log/distributed-training/) for detailed explanations of these approaches, including code examples with Torch DDP.

75 - How do I add Plotly or Bokeh Charts into Tables?
=====================================================

Direct integration of Plotly or Bokeh figures into tables is not supported. Instead, export the figures to HTML and include the HTML in the table. Below are examples demonstrating this with interactive Plotly and Bokeh charts.

* Using Plotly
* Using Bokeh

```
import wandb
import plotly.express as px

# Initialize a new run
run = wandb.init(project="log-plotly-fig-tables", name="plotly_html")

# Create a table
table = wandb.Table(columns=["plotly_figure"])

# Define path for Plotly figure
path_to_plotly_html = "./plotly_figure.html"

# Create a Plotly figure
fig = px.scatter(x=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], y=[0, 1, 4, 9, 16])

# Export Plotly figure to HTML
# Setting auto_play to False prevents animated Plotly charts from playing automatically
fig.write_html(path_to_plotly_html, auto_play=False)

# Add Plotly figure as HTML file to the table
table.add_data(wandb.Html(path_to_plotly_html))

# Log Table
run.log({"test_table": table})
wandb.finish()

```

```
from scipy.signal import spectrogram
import holoviews as hv
import panel as pn
from scipy.io import wavfile
import numpy as np
from bokeh.resources import INLINE

hv.extension("bokeh", logo=False)
import wandb

def save_audio_with_bokeh_plot_to_html(audio_path, html_file_name):
    sr, wav_data = wavfile.read(audio_path)
    duration = len(wav_data) / sr
    f, t, sxx = spectrogram(wav_data, sr)
    spec_gram = hv.Image((t, f, np.log10(sxx)), ["Time (s)", "Frequency (Hz)"]).opts(
        width=500, height=150, labelled=[]
    )
    audio = pn.pane.Audio(wav_data, sample_rate=sr, name="Audio", throttle=500)
    slider = pn.widgets.FloatSlider(end=duration, visible=False)
    line = hv.VLine(0).opts(color="white")
    slider.jslink(audio, value="time", bidirectional=True)
    slider.jslink(line, value="glyph.location")
    combined = pn.Row(audio, spec_gram * line, slider).save(html_file_name)

html_file_name = "audio_with_plot.html"
audio_path = "hello.wav"
save_audio_with_bokeh_plot_to_html(audio_path, html_file_name)

wandb_html = wandb.Html(html_file_name)
run = wandb.init(project="audio_test")
my_table = wandb.Table(columns=["audio_with_plot"], data=[[wandb_html], [wandb_html]])
run.log({"audio_table": my_table})
run.finish()

```

76 - How do I best log models from runs in a sweep?
===================================================

One effective approach for logging models in a [sweep](/guides/sweeps/) involves creating a model artifact for the sweep. Each version represents a different run from the sweep. Implement it as follows:

```
wandb.Artifact(name="sweep_name", type="model")

```

77 - How do I cancel my subscription?
=====================================

* Contact the support team ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)).
* Provide the organization name, email associated with the account, and username.

78 - How do I change my billing address?
========================================

To change the billing address, contact the support team ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)).

79 - How do I deal with network issues?
=======================================

If you encounter SSL or network errors, such as `wandb: Network error (ConnectionError), entering retry loop`, use the following solutions:

1. Upgrade the SSL certificate. On an Ubuntu server, run `update-ca-certificates`. A valid SSL certificate is essential for syncing training logs to mitigate security risks.
2. If the network connection is unstable, operate in offline mode by setting the [optional environment variable](/guides/track/environment-variables/#optional-environment-variables) `WANDB_MODE` to `offline`, and sync files later from a device with Internet access.
3. Consider using [W&B Private Hosting](/guides/hosting/), which runs locally and avoids syncing to cloud servers.

For the `SSL CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error, this issue might stem from a company firewall. Configure local CAs and execute:

`export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

80 - How do I delete a panel grid?

To downgrade a subscription plan, contact the support team at [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com) with your current plan details and the desired plan.

84 - How do I enable code logging with Sweeps?
==============================================

To enable code logging for sweeps, add `wandb.log_code()` after initializing the W&B Run. This action is necessary even when code logging is enabled in the W&B profile settings. For advanced code logging, refer to the [docs for `wandb.log_code()` here](/ref/python/run/#log_code).

85 - How do I export a list of users from my W&B Organisation?
==============================================================

To export a list of users from a W&B organization, an admin uses the SCIM API with the following code:

```
import base64
import requests

def encode_base64(username, key):
    auth_string = f'{username}:{key}'
    return base64.b64encode(auth_string.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')

username = ''  # Organization admin username
key = ''  # API key
scim_base_url = 'https://api.wandb.ai/scim/v2'
users_endpoint = f'{scim_base_url}/Users'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Basic {encode_base64(username, key)}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/scim+json'
}

response = requests.get(users_endpoint, headers=headers)
users = []
for user in response.json()['Resources']:
    users.append([user['userName'], user['emails']['Value']])

```

Modify the script to save the output as needed.

86 - How do I find an artifact from the best run in a sweep?
============================================================

To retrieve artifacts from the best performing run in a sweep, use the following code:

```
api = wandb.Api()
sweep = api.sweep("entity/project/sweep_id")
runs = sorted(sweep.runs, key=lambda run: run.summary.get("val_acc", 0), reverse=True)
best_run = runs[0]
for artifact in best_run.logged_artifacts():
    artifact_path = artifact.download()
    print(artifact_path)

```

87 - How do I find my API key?
==============================

To find your API key for Weights and Biases (W&B):

* Log in to W&B at <https://wandb.ai/authorize>.
* Alternatively, access your profile:
  1. Click your user profile in the upper right corner.
  2. Select “User Settings.”
  3. Scroll to the “Danger Zone” section.
  4. Click “Reveal” next to “API Keys.”

88 - How do I fix the "overflows maximum values of a signed 64 bits integer" error?
===================================================================================

To resolve this error, add `?workspace=clear` to the end of the URL and press Enter. This action directs you to a cleared version of the project page workspace.

89 - How do I fix the error `resume='must' but run (<run\_id>) doesn't exist`?
==============================================================================

If you encounter the error `resume='must' but run (<run_id>) doesn't exist`, the run you are attempting to resume does not exist within the project or entity. Ensure that you are logged in to the correct instance and that the project and entity are set:

```
wandb.init(entity=<entity>, project=<project>, id=<run-id>, resume='must')

```

Run [`wandb login --relogin`](/ref/cli/wandb-login/) to verify that you are authenticated.

90 - How do I get added to a team on W&B?
=========================================

To join a team, follow these steps:

* Contact a team admin or someone with administrative privileges to request an invite.
* Check your email for the invitation, and follow the instructions to join the team.

91 - How do I get the random run name in my script?
===================================================

Call `wandb.run.save()` to save the current run. Retrieve the name using `wandb.run.name`.

92 - How do I handle the 'Failed to query for notebook' error?
==============================================================

If you encounter the error message `"Failed to query for notebook name, you can set it manually with the WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME environment variable,"` resolve it by setting the environment variable. Multiple methods accomplish this:

* Notebook
* Python

```
%env "WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME" "notebook name here"

```

```
import os

os.environ["WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME"] = "notebook name here"

```

93 - How do I insert a table?
=============================

Tables remain the only feature from Markdown without a direct WYSIWYG equivalent. To add a table, insert a Markdown block and create the table inside it.

94 - How do I install the wandb Python library in environments without gcc?
===========================================================================

If an error occurs when installing `wandb` that states:

```
unable to execute 'gcc': No such file or directory
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

```

Install `psutil` directly from a pre-built wheel. Determine your Python version and operating system at <https://pywharf.github.io/pywharf-pkg-repo/psutil>.

For example, to install `psutil` on Python 3.8 in Linux:

```
WHEEL_URL=https://github.com/pywharf/pywharf-pkg-repo/releases/download/psutil-5.7.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl#sha256=adc36dabdff0b9a4c84821ef5ce45848f30b8a01a1d5806316e068b5fd669c6d
pip install $WHEEL_URL

```

After installing `psutil`, run `pip install wandb` to complete the installation of `wandb`.

95 - How do I kill a job with wandb?
====================================

Press `Ctrl+D` on the keyboard to stop a script instrumented with W&B.

96 - How do I launch multiple runs from one script?
===================================================

Use `wandb.init` and `run.finish()` to log multiple runs within a single script:

1. Use `run = wandb.init(reinit=True)` to allow reinitialization of runs.
2. Call `run.finish()` at the end of each run to complete logging.

```
import wandb

for x in range(10):
    run = wandb.init(reinit=True)
    for y in range(100):
        wandb.log({"metric": x + y})
    run.finish()

```

Alternatively, utilize a Python context manager to automatically finish logging:

```
import wandb

for x in range(10):
    run = wandb.init(reinit=True)
    with run:
        for y in range(100):
            run.log({"metric": x + y})

```

97 - How do I log a list of values?
===================================

These examples show logging losses a couple of different ways using [`wandb.log()`](/ref/python/log/).

* Using a dictionary
* As a histogram

```
wandb.log({f"losses/loss-{ii}": loss for ii, 
  loss in enumerate(losses)})

```

```
# Converts losses to a histogram
wandb.log({"losses": wandb.Histogram(losses)})  

```

For more, see [the documentation on logging](/guides/track/log/).

98 - How do I log an artifact to an existing run?
=================================================

Occasionally, it is necessary to mark an artifact as the output of a previously logged run. In this case, reinitialize the old run and log new artifacts as follows:

```
with wandb.init(id="existing_run_id", resume="allow") as run:
    artifact = wandb.Artifact("artifact_name", "artifact_type")
    artifact.add_file("my_data/file.txt")
    run.log_artifact(artifact)

```

99 - How do I log runs launched by continuous integration or internal tools?
============================================================================

To launch automated tests or internal tools that log to W&B, create a **Service Account** on the team settings page. This action allows the use of a service API key for automated jobs, including those running through continuous integration. To attribute service account jobs to a specific user, set the `WANDB_USERNAME` or `WANDB_USER_EMAIL` environment variables.

![Create a service account on your team settings page for automated jobs](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/track/common_questions_automate_runs.png)

100 - How do I log to the right wandb user on a shared machine?
===============================================================

When using a shared machine, ensure that runs log to the correct WandB account by setting the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication. If sourced in the environment, this variable provides the correct credentials upon login. Alternatively, set the environment variable directly in the script.

Execute the command `export WANDB_API_KEY=X`, replacing X with your API key. Logged-in users can find their API key at [wandb.ai/authorize](https://app.wandb.ai/authorize).

101 - How do I plot multiple lines on a plot with a legend?
===========================================================

Create a multi-line custom chart with `wandb.plot.line_series()`. Navigate to the [project page](/guides/track/project-page/) to view the line chart. To add a legend, include the `keys` argument in `wandb.plot.line_series()`. For example:

```
wandb.log(
    {
        "my_plot": wandb.plot.line_series(
            xs=x_data, ys=y_data, keys=["metric_A", "metric_B"]
        )
    }
)

```

Refer to additional details about multi-line plots [here](/guides/track/log/plots/#basic-charts) under the **Multi-line** tab.

102 - How do I programmatically access the human-readable run name?
===================================================================

The `.name` attribute of a [`wandb.Run`](/ref/python/run/) is accessible as follows:

```
import wandb

wandb.init()
run_name = wandb.run.name

```

103 - How do I rename a project?
================================

To rename a project:

* Navigate to the Project overview.
* Click on **Edit Project**.

Note:

* If the project name is protected, such as `model-registry`, it cannot be renamed. Contact support for assistance with protected names.

104 - How do I renew my expired license?
========================================

To renew an expired license, contact the support team at [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com) for assistance with the renewal process and to receive a new license key.

105 - How do I request the complete deletion of my W&B account?
===============================================================

To delete a W&B account, navigate to the **Settings** page, scroll to the bottom, and click the **Delete Account** button.

106 - How do I resolve a run initialization timeout error in wandb?
===================================================================

To resolve a run initialization timeout error, follow these steps:

* **Retry initialization**: Attempt to restart the run.
* **Check network connection**: Confirm a stable internet connection.
* **Update wandb version**: Install the latest version of wandb.
* **Increase timeout settings**: Modify the `WANDB_INIT_TIMEOUT` environment variable:

  ```
  import os
  os.environ['WANDB_INIT_TIMEOUT'] = '600'

  ```
* **Enable debugging**: Set `WANDB_DEBUG=true` and `WANDB_CORE_DEBUG=true` for detailed logs.
* **Verify configuration**: Check that the API key and project settings are correct.
* **Review logs**: Inspect `debug.log`, `debug-internal.log`, `debug-core.log`, and `output.log` for errors.

107 - How do I resolve permission errors when logging a run?
============================================================

To resolve permission errors when logging a run to a W&B entity, follow these steps:

* **Verify entity and project names**: Ensure correct spelling and case sensitivity of the W&B entity and project names in your code.
* **Confirm permissions**: Ensure necessary permissions have been granted by the administrator.
* **Check log-in credentials**: Confirm log-in to the correct W&B account. Test by creating a run with the following code:

  ```
  import wandb

  run = wandb.init(entity="your_entity", project="your_project")
  run.log({'example_metric': 1})
  run.finish()

  ```
* **Set API key**: Use the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable:

  ```
  export WANDB_API_KEY='your_api_key'

  ```
* **Confirm host information**: For custom deployments, set the host URL:

  ```
  wandb login --relogin --host=<host-url>
  export WANDB_BASE_URL=<host-url>

  ```

108 - How do I save code?‌
==========================

Use `save_code=True` in `wandb.init` to save the main script or notebook that launches the run. To save all code for a run, version the code with Artifacts. The following example demonstrates this process:

```
code_artifact = wandb.Artifact(type="code")
code_artifact.add_file("./train.py")
wandb.log_artifact(code_artifact)

```

109 - How do I set a retention or expiration policy on my artifact?
===================================================================

To manage artifacts that contain sensitive data or to schedule the deletion of artifact versions, set a TTL (time-to-live) policy. For detailed instructions, refer to the [TTL guide](/guides/artifacts/ttl/).

110 - How do I silence W&B info messages?
=========================================

To suppress log messages in your notebook such as this:

```
INFO SenderThread:11484 [sender.py:finish():979]

```

Set the log level to `logging.ERROR` to only show errors, suppressing output of info-level log output.

```
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)

```

To turn off log output completely, set the `WANDB_SILENT` environment variable. This must occur in a notebook cell before running `wandb.login`:

* Notebook
* Python

```
%env WANDB_SILENT=True

```

```
import os

os.environ["WANDB_SILENT"] = "True"

```

111 - How do I stop wandb from writing to my terminal or my Jupyter notebook output?
====================================================================================

Set the environment variable [`WANDB_SILENT`](/guides/track/environment-variables/) to `true`.

* Python
* Notebook
* Command-Line

```
os.environ["WANDB_SILENT"] = "true"

```

```
%env WANDB_SILENT=true

```

```
WANDB_SILENT=true

```

112 - How do I switch between accounts on the same machine?
===========================================================

To manage two W&B accounts from the same machine, store both API keys in a file. Use the following code in your repositories to switch between keys securely, preventing secret keys from being checked into source control.

```
if os.path.exists("~/keys.json"):
    os.environ["WANDB_API_KEY"] = json.loads("~/keys.json")["work_account"]

```

113 - How do I turn off logging?
================================

The command `wandb offline` sets the environment variable `WANDB_MODE=offline`, preventing data from syncing to the remote W&B server. This action affects all projects, stopping the logging of data to W&B servers.

To suppress warning messages, use the following code:

```
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)

```

114 - How do I use custom CLI commands with sweeps?
===================================================

You can use W&B Sweeps with custom CLI commands if training configuration passes command-line arguments.

In the example below, the code snippet illustrates a bash terminal where a user trains a Python script named `train.py`, providing values that the script parses:

```
/usr/bin/env python train.py -b \
    your-training-config \
    --batchsize 8 \
    --lr 0.00001

```

To implement custom commands, modify the `command` key in the YAML file. Based on the previous example, the configuration appears as follows:

```
program:
  train.py
method: grid
parameters:
  batch_size:
    value: 8
  lr:
    value: 0.0001
command:
  - ${env}
  - python
  - ${program}
  - "-b"
  - your-training-config
  - ${args}

```

The `${args}` key expands to all parameters in the sweep configuration, formatted for `argparse` as `--param1 value1 --param2 value2`.

For additional arguments outside of `argparse`, implement the following:

```
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
args, unknown = parser.parse_known_args()

```

Depending on the environment, `python` might refer to Python 2. To ensure invocation of Python 3, use `python3` in the command configuration:

```
program:
  script.py
command:
  - ${env}
  - python3
  - ${program}
  - ${args}

```

115 - How do I use the resume parameter when resuming a run in W&B?
===================================================================

To use the `resume` parameter in W&B , set the `resume` argument in `wandb.init()` with `entity`, `project`, and `id` specified. The `resume` argument accepts values of `"must"` or `"allow"`.

```
run = wandb.init(entity="your-entity", project="your-project", id="your-run-id", resume="must")

```

116 - How do we update our payment method?
==========================================

To update your payment method, follow these steps:

1. **Go to your profile page**: First, navigate to your user profile page.
2. **Select your Organization**: Choose the relevant organization from the Account selector.
3. **Access Billing settings**: Under **Account**, select **Billing**.
4. **Add a new payment method**:
   * Click **Add payment method**.
   * Enter your new card details and select the option to make it your **primary** payment method.

> **Note:** To manage billing, you must be assigned as the billing admin for your organization.

117 - How do you delete a custom chart preset?
==============================================

Access the custom chart editor. Click on the currently selected chart type to open a menu displaying all presets. Hover over the preset to delete, then click the Trash icon.

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/app_ui/delete_custome_chart_preset.gif)

118 - How do you show a "step slider" in a custom chart?
========================================================

Enable this option on the “Other settings” page of the custom chart editor. Changing the query to use a `historyTable` instead of a `summaryTable` provides the option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This feature includes a slider for selecting the step.

119 - How does someone without an account see run results?
==========================================================

If someone runs the script with `anonymous="allow"`:

1. **Auto-create temporary account**: W&B checks for a signed-in account. If none exists, W&B creates a new anonymous account and saves the API key for that session.
2. **Log results quickly**: Users can repeatedly run the script and instantly view results in the W&B dashboard. These unclaimed anonymous runs remain available for 7 days.
3. **Claim data when it’s useful**: Once a user identifies valuable results in W&B, they can click a button in the banner at the top of the page to save their run data to a real account. Without claiming, the run data deletes after 7 days.

**Anonymous run links are sensitive**. These links permit anyone to view and claim experiment results for 7 days, so share links only with trusted individuals. For publicly sharing results while hiding the author’s identity, contact [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com) for assistance.

When a W&B user finds and runs the script, their results log correctly to their account, just like a normal run.

120 - How does wandb stream logs and writes to disk?
====================================================

W&B queues events in memory and writes them to disk asynchronously to manage failures and support the `WANDB_MODE=offline` configuration, allowing synchronization after logging.

In the terminal, observe the path to the local run directory. This directory includes a `.wandb` file, which serves as the datastore. For image logging, W&B stores images in the `media/images` subdirectory before uploading them to cloud storage.

121 - How is W&B different from TensorBoard?
============================================

W&B integrates with TensorBoard and improves experiment tracking tools. The founders created W&B to address common frustrations faced by TensorBoard users. Key improvements include:

1. **Model Reproducibility**: W&B facilitates experimentation, exploration, and model reproduction. It captures metrics, hyperparameters, code versions, and saves model checkpoints to ensure reproducibility.
2. **Automatic Organization**: W&B streamlines project handoffs and vacations by providing an overview of all attempted models, which saves time by preventing the re-execution of old experiments.
3. **Quick Integration**: Integrate W&B into your project in five minutes. Install the free open-source Python package and add a few lines of code. Logged metrics and records appear with each model run.
4. **Centralized Dashboard**: Access a consistent dashboard regardless of where training occurs—locally, on lab clusters, or cloud spot instances. Eliminate the need to manage TensorBoard files across different machines.
5. **Robust Filtering Table**: Search, filter, sort, and group results from various models efficiently. Easily identify the best-performing models for different tasks, an area where TensorBoard often struggles with larger projects.
6. **Collaboration Tools**: W&B enhances collaboration for complex machine learning projects. Share project links and utilize private teams for result sharing. Create reports with interactive visualizations and markdown descriptions for work logs or presentations.

122 - How many runs can I create per project?
=============================================

Limit each project to approximately 10,000 runs for optimal performance.

123 - How much storage does each artifact version use?
======================================================

Only files that change between two artifact versions incur storage costs.

![v1 of the artifact 'dataset' has only 2 out of 5 images that differ, so it occupies only 40% of the space.](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/artifacts/artifacts-dedupe.PNG)

Consider an image artifact named `animals` that contains two image files, `cat.png` and `dog.png`:

```
images
|-- cat.png (2MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- dog.png (1MB) # Added in `v0`

```

This artifact receives version `v0`.

When adding a new image, `rat.png`, a new artifact version, `v1`, is created with the following contents:

```
images
|-- cat.png (2MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- dog.png (1MB) # Added in `v0`
|-- rat.png (3MB) # Added in `v1`

```

Version `v1` tracks a total of 6MB, but occupies only 3MB of space since it shares the remaining 3MB with `v0`. Deleting `v1` reclaims the 3MB of storage associated with `rat.png`. Deleting `v0` transfers the storage costs of `cat.png` and `dog.png` to `v1`, increasing its storage size to 6MB.

124 - How often are system metrics collected?
=============================================

Metrics collect by default every 10 seconds. For higher resolution metrics, email [contact@wandb.com](mailto:contact@wandb.com).

125 - How should I run sweeps on SLURM?
=======================================

When using sweeps with the [SLURM scheduling system](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html), run `wandb agent --count 1 SWEEP_ID` in each scheduled job. This command executes a single training job and then exits, facilitating runtime predictions for resource requests while leveraging the parallelism of hyperparameter searches.

126 - How to get multiple charts with different selected runs?
==============================================================

With W&B Reports, follow these steps:

1. Create multiple panel grids.
2. Apply filters to select the desired run sets for each panel grid.
3. Generate the desired charts within the panel grids.

127 - Hyperparameter
====================

The following support questions are tagged with **Hyperparameter**. If you don’t see
your question answered, try [asking the community](https://community.wandb.ai/),
or email [support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com).

* [Best practices to organize hyperparameter searches](/support/best_practices_organize_hyperparameter_searches/)
* [Can I rerun a grid search?](/support/rerun_grid_search/)
* [What is the `Est. Runs` column?](/support/est_runs_column/)

128 - I converted my report to WYSIWYG but want to revert back to Markdown
==========================================================================

If the report conversion occurred through the message at the top, click the red “Revert” button to restore the prior state. Note that any changes made after conversion will be lost.

If a single Markdown block was converted, use `cmd+z` to undo.

If options to revert are unavailable because of a closed session, consider discarding the draft or editing from the last saved version. If neither works, contact W&B Support.

129 - I didn't name my run. Where is the run name coming from?
==============================================================

If a run is not explicitly named, W&B assigns a random name to identify it in your project. Examples of random names are `pleasant-flower-4` and `misunderstood-glade-2.

130 - If I am the admin of my local instance, how should I manage it?
=====================================================================

If you are the admin for your instance, review the [User Management](/guides/hosting/iam/access-management/manage-organization/) section for instructions on adding users and creating teams.

131 - If wandb crashes, will it possibly crash my training run?
===============================================================

It is critical to avoid interference with training runs. W&B operates in a separate process, ensuring that training continues even if W&B experiences a crash. In the event of an internet outage, W&B continually retries sending data to [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai).

132 - Incorporating LaTeX
=========================

LaTeX integrates seamlessly into reports. To add LaTeX, create a new report and begin typing in the rich text area to write notes and save custom visualizations and tables.

On a new line, press `/` and navigate to the inline equations tab to insert LaTeX content.

133 - InitStartError: Error communicating with wandb process
============================================================

This error indicates that the library encounters an issue launching the process that synchronizes data to the server.

The following workarounds resolve the issue in specific environments:

* Linux and OS X
* Google Colab

```
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(start_method="fork"))

```

For versions prior to `0.13.0`, use:

```
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(start_method="thread"))

```

134 - Is it possible to add the same service account to multiple teams?
=======================================================================

A service account cannot be added to multiple teams in W&B. Each service account is tied to a specific team.

135 - Is it possible to change the group assigned to a run after completion?
============================================================================

You can change the group assigned to a completed run using the API. This feature does not appear in the web UI. Use the following code to update the group:

```
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("<ENTITY>/<PROJECT>/<RUN_ID>")
run.group = "NEW-GROUP-NAME"
run.update()

```

136 - Is it possible to change the username?
============================================

Changing the username after account creation is not possible. Create a new account with the desired username instead.

137 - Is it possible to create a new account with an email that was previously used for a deleted account?
==========================================================================================================

A new account can use an email previously associated with a deleted account.

138 - Is it possible to move a run from one project to another?
===============================================================

You can move a run from one project to another by following these steps:

* Navigate to the project page with the run to be moved.
* Click on the **Runs** tab to open the runs table.
* Select the runs to move.
* Click the **Move** button.
* Choose the destination project and confirm the action.

W&B supports moving runs through the UI, but does not support copying runs. Artifacts logged with the runs do not transfer to the new project. To move artifacts to the run’s new location manually, you can use the [`wandb artifact get`](/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-get/) SDK command or the [`Api.artifact` API](/ref/python/public-api/api/#artifact) to download the artifact, then use [wandb artifact put](/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-put/) or the `Api.artifact` API to upload it to the run’s new location.

139 - Is it possible to plot the max of a metric rather than plot step by step?
===============================================================================

Create a scatter plot of the metric. Open the **Edit** menu and select **Annotations**. From there, plot the running maximum of the values.

140 - Is it possible to recover an artifact after it has been deleted with a run?
=================================================================================

When deleting a run, a prompt asks whether to delete the associated artifacts. Choosing this option permanently removes the artifacts, making recovery impossible, even if the run itself is restored later.

141 - Is it possible to save metrics offline and sync them to W&B later?
========================================================================

By default, `wandb.init` starts a process that syncs metrics in real time to the cloud. For offline use, set two environment variables to enable offline mode and sync later.

Set the following environment variables:

1. `WANDB_API_KEY=$KEY`, where `$KEY` is the API Key from your [settings page](https://app.wandb.ai/settings).
2. `WANDB_MODE="offline"`.

Here is an example of implementing this in a script:

```
import wandb
import os

os.environ["WANDB_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
os.environ["WANDB_MODE"] = "offline"

config = {
    "dataset": "CIFAR10",
    "machine": "offline cluster",

142 - Is there a dark mode?
===========================

Dark mode is in beta and not optimized for accessibility. To enable dark mode:

1. Go to your account settings at <https://wandb.ai/settings>.
2. Scroll to the **Public preview features** section.
3. In **UI Display**, select **Dark mode** from the dropdown.

143 - Is there a monthly subscription option for the teams plan?
================================================================

The Teams plan does not offer a monthly subscription option. This subscription is billed annually.

144 - Is there a W&B outage?
============================

Check if the W&B multi-tenant cloud at wandb.ai is experiencing an outage by visiting the W&B status page at <https://status.wandb.com>.

145 - Is there a way to add extra values to a sweep, or do I need to start a new one?
=====================================================================================

Once a W&B Sweep starts, you cannot change the Sweep configuration. However, you can navigate to any table view, select runs using the checkboxes, and then choose the **Create sweep** menu option to generate a new Sweep configuration based on previous runs.

146 - Is there a way to add more seats?
=======================================

To add more seats to an account, follow these steps:

* Contact the Account Executive or support team ([support@wandb.com](mailto:support@wandb.com)) for assistance.
* Provide the organization name and the desired number of seats.

147 - Is there an anaconda package for Weights and Biases?
==========================================================

There is an anaconda package that is installable using either `pip` or `conda`. For `conda`, obtain the package from the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) channel.

* pip
* conda

```
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n wandb-env python=3.8 anaconda
# Activate the environment
conda activate wandb-env
# Install wandb using pip
pip install wandb

```

```
conda activate myenv
conda install wandb --channel conda-forge

```

For installation issues, refer to this Anaconda [documentation on managing packages](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html) for assistance.

150 - My report is running slowly after the change to WYSIWYG
=============================================================

Performance issues may arise on older hardware or with very large reports. To mitigate this, collapse sections of the report that are not currently in use.

151 - My report looks different after converting from Markdown.
===============================================================

The goal is to maintain the original appearance after transitioning to WYSIWYG, but the conversion process is not flawless. If significant discrepancies arise, report them for evaluation. Users can revert to the previous state until the editing session concludes.

152 - My run's state is `crashed` on the UI but is still running on my machine. What do I do to get my data back?
=================================================================================================================

You likely lost connection to your machine during training. Recover data by running [`wandb sync [PATH_TO_RUN]`](/ref/cli/wandb-sync/). The path to your run is a folder in your `wandb` directory that matches the Run ID of the ongoing run.

153 - Notebooks
===============

* [How do I handle the ‘Failed to query for notebook’ error?](/support/query_notebook_failed/)
* [How do I silence W&B info messages?](/support/silence_info_messages/)

154 - On a local instance, which files should I check when I have issues?
=========================================================================

Check the `Debug Bundle`. An admin can retrieve it from the `/system-admin` page by selecting the W&B icon in the top right corner and then choosing `Debug Bundle`.

![Access System settings page as an Admin of a local instance](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/technical_faq/local_system_settings.png)
![Download the Debug Bundle as an Admin of a local instance](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/technical_faq/debug_bundle.png)

155 - Optimizing multiple metrics
=================================

To optimize multiple metrics in a single run, use a weighted sum of the individual metrics.

```
metric_combined = 0.3 * metric_a + 0.2 * metric_b + ... + 1.5 * metric_n
wandb.log({"metric_combined": metric_combined})

```

Log the new combined metric and set it as the optimization objective:

```
metric:
  name: metric_combined
  goal: minimize

```

* [What type of roles are available and what are the differences between them?](/support/type_roles_available_differences/)

173 - Using artifacts with multiple architectures and runs?
===========================================================

There are various methods to version a model. Artifacts provide a tool for model versioning tailored to specific needs. A common approach for projects that explore multiple model architectures involves separating artifacts by architecture. Consider the following steps:

1. Create a new artifact for each distinct model architecture. Use the `metadata` attribute of artifacts to provide detailed descriptions of the architecture, similar to the use of `config` for a run.
2. For each model, log checkpoints periodically with `log_artifact`. W&B builds a history of these checkpoints, labeling the most recent one with the `latest` alias. Refer to the latest checkpoint for any model architecture using `architecture-name:latest`.

174 - What are features that are not available to anonymous users?
==================================================================

* **No persistent data**: Runs save for 7 days in an anonymous account. Claim anonymous run data by saving it to a real account.

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/app_ui/anon_mode_no_data.png)

* **No artifact logging**: A warning appears on the command line when attempting to log an artifact to an anonymous run:

  ```
  wandb: WARNING Artifacts logged anonymously cannot be claimed and expire after 7 days.

  ```
* **No profile or settings pages**: The UI does not include certain pages, as they are only useful for real accounts.

175 - What does wandb.init do to my training process?
=====================================================

When `wandb.init()` runs in a training script, an API call creates a run object on the servers. A new process starts to stream and collect metrics, allowing the primary process to function normally. The script writes to local files while the separate process streams data to the servers, including system metrics. To turn off streaming, run `wandb off` from the training directory or set the `WANDB_MODE` environment variable to `offline`.

176 - What formula do you use for your smoothing algorithm?
===========================================================

The exponential moving average formula aligns with the one used in TensorBoard.

Refer to this [explanation on Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42281844/what-is-the-mathematics-behind-the-smoothing-parameter-in-tensorboards-scalar/75421930#75421930) for details on the equivalent Python implementation. The source code to TensorBoard’s smoothing algorithm (as of this writing) can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/34877f15153e1a2087316b9952c931807a122aa7/tensorboard/components/vz_line_chart2/line-chart.ts#L699).

177 - What happens if I edit my Python files while a sweep is running?
======================================================================

While a sweep is running:

* If the `train.py` script which the sweep uses changes, the sweep continues to use the original `train.py`
* If files that the `train.py` script references change, such as helper functions in the `helper.py` script, the sweep begins to use the updated `helper.py`.

178 - What happens if I pass a class attribute into wandb.log()?
================================================================

Avoid passing class attributes into `wandb.log()`. Attributes may change before the network call executes. When storing metrics as class attributes, use a deep copy to ensure the logged metric matches the attribute’s value at the time of the `wandb.log()` call.

179 - What happens if internet connection is lost while I'm training a model?
=============================================================================

If the library cannot connect to the internet, it enters a retry loop and continues to attempt to stream metrics until the network is restored. The program continues to run during this time.

To run on a machine without internet, set `WANDB_MODE=offline`. This configuration stores metrics locally on the hard drive. Later, call `wandb sync DIRECTORY` to stream the data to the server.

180 - What happens when I log millions of steps to W&B? How is that rendered in the browser?
============================================================================================

The number of points sent affects the loading time of graphs in the UI. For lines exceeding 1,000 points, the backend samples the data down to 1,000 points before sending it to the browser. This sampling is nondeterministic, resulting in different sampled points upon page refresh.

Log fewer than 10,000 points per metric. Logging over 1 million points in a line significantly increases page load time. Explore strategies to minimize logging footprint without sacrificing accuracy in this [Colab](http://wandb.me/log-hf-colab). With more than 500 columns of config and summary metrics, only 500 display in the table.

181 - What if I want to integrate W&B into my project, but I don't want to upload any images or media?
======================================================================================================

W&B supports projects that log only scalars by allowing explicit specification of files or data for upload. Refer to this [example in PyTorch](http://wandb.me/pytorch-colab) that demonstrates logging without using images.

182 - What if I want to log some metrics on batches and some metrics only on epochs?
====================================================================================

To log specific metrics in each batch and standardize plots, log the desired x-axis values alongside the metrics. In the custom plots, click edit and select a custom x-axis.

```
wandb.log({"batch": batch_idx, "loss": 0.3})
wandb.log({"epoch": epoch, "val_acc": 0.94})

```

183 - What is a service account, and why is it useful?
======================================================

A service account (Enterprise-only feature) represents a non-human or machine user, which can automate common tasks across teams and projects or ones that are not specific to a particular human user. You can create a service account within a team and use its API key to read from and write to projects within that team.

Among other things, service accounts are useful for tracking automated jobs logged to wandb, like periodic retraining, nightly builds, and so on. If you’d like, you can associate a username with one of these machine-launched runs with the [environment variables](/guides/track/environment-variables/) `WANDB_USERNAME` or `WANDB_USER_EMAIL`.

Refer to [Team Service Account Behavior](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/#team-service-account-behavior) for more information.

You can get the API key for a service account in your team at `<WANDB_HOST_URL>/<your-team-name>/service-accounts`. Alternatively you can go to the **Team settings** for your team and then refer to the **Service Accounts** tab.

To create a new service account for your team:

* Press the **+ New service account** button in the **Service Accounts** tab of your team
* Provide a name in the **Name** field
* Select **Generate API key (Built-in)** as the authentication method
* Press the **Create** button
* Click the **Copy API key** button for the newly created service account and store it in a secret manager or another safe but accessible location

Apart from the **Built-in** service accounts, W&B also supports **External service accounts** using [identity federation for SDK and CLI](/guides/hosting/iam/identity_federation/#external-service-accounts). Use external service accounts if you are looking to automate W&B tasks using service identities managed in your identity provider that can issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

184 - What is a team and where can I find more information about it?
====================================================================

For additional information about teams, visit the [teams section](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/).

185 - What is the `Est. Runs` column?
=====================================

W&B provides an estimated number of Runs generated when creating a W&B Sweep with a discrete search space. This total reflects the cartesian product of the search space.

For instance, consider the following search space:

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/sweeps/sweeps_faq_whatisestruns_1.png)

In this case, the Cartesian product equals 9. W&B displays this value in the App UI as the estimated run count (**Est. Runs**):

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/sweeps/spaces_sweeps_faq_whatisestruns_2.webp)

To retrieve the estimated Run count programmatically, use the `expected_run_count` attribute of the Sweep object within the W&B SDK:

```
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(
    sweep_configs, project="your_project_name", entity="your_entity_name"
)
api = wandb.Api()
sweep = api.sweep(f"your_entity_name/your_project_name/sweeps/{sweep_id}")
print(f"EXPECTED RUN COUNT = {sweep.expected_run_count}")

```

186 - What is the difference between `.log()` and `.summary`?
=============================================================

The summary displays in the table, while the log saves all values for future plotting.

For instance, call `wandb.log` whenever accuracy changes. By default, `wandb.log()` updates the summary value unless set manually for that metric.

The scatterplot and parallel coordinate plots use the summary value, while the line plot shows all values recorded by `.log`.

Some users prefer to set the summary manually to reflect the optimal accuracy instead of the most recent accuracy logged.

187 - What is the difference between team and entity? As a user - what does entity mean for me?
===============================================================================================

A team serves as a collaborative workspace for users working on the same projects. An entity represents either a username or a team name. When logging runs in W&B, set the entity to a personal or team account using `wandb.init(entity="example-team")`.

188 - What is the difference between team and organization?
===========================================================

A team serves as a collaborative workspace for users working on the same projects. An organization functions as a higher-level entity that can include multiple teams, often related to billing and account management.

189 - What is the difference between wandb.init modes?
======================================================

These modes are available:

* `online` (default): The client sends data to the wandb server.
* `offline`: The client stores data locally on the machine instead of sending it to the wandb server. Use the [`wandb sync`](/ref/cli/wandb-sync/) command to synchronize the data later.
* `disabled`: The client simulates operation by returning mocked objects and prevents any network communication. All logging is turned off, but all API method stubs remain callable. This mode is typically used for testing.

190 - What really good functionalities are hidden and where can I find those?
=============================================================================

Some functionalities are hidden under a feature flag in the **Beta Features** section of a team’s settings.

![Available beta features hidden under a feature flag](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/technical_faq/beta_features.png)

191 - What type of roles are available and what are the differences between them?
=================================================================================

Visit [this](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/#team-roles-and-permissions) page for an overview of the available roles and permissions.

192 - When should I log to my personal entity against my team entity?
=====================================================================

Personal Entities are unavailable for accounts created after May 21, 2024. W&B encourages all users to log new projects to a Team to enable sharing of results.

193 - Where are artifacts downloaded, and how can I control that?
=================================================================

By default, artifacts download to the `artifacts/` folder. To change the location:

* Pass it to [`wandb.Artifact().download`](/ref/python/public-api/api/):

  ```
  wandb.Artifact().download(root="<path_to_download>")

  ```
* Set the `WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR` [environment variable](/guides/track/environment-variables/):

  ```
  import os
  os.environ["WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR"] = "<path_to_download>"

  ```

194 - Which files should I check when my code crashes?
======================================================

For the affected run, check `debug.log` and `debug-internal.log` in `wandb/run-<date>_<time>-<run-id>/logs` in the directory where your code is running.

195 - Who can create a team? Who can add or delete people from a team? Who can delete projects?
===============================================================================================

Refer to the link for details on roles and permissions: [Team Roles and Permissions](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/#team-roles-and-permissions).

196 - Who can edit and share reports?
=====================================

Reports created within an individual’s private project remain visible only to that user. The user can share their project with a team or the public.

In team projects, the administrator or the member who created the report can toggle permissions between edit and view access for other team members. Team members can share reports.

To share a report, select the **Share** button in the upper right corner. Provide an email address or copy the magic link. Users invited by email must log into W&B to view the report, while users with a magic link do not need to log in.

Shared reports maintain view-only access.

197 - Who has access to my artifacts?
=====================================

Artifacts inherit access permissions from their parent project:

* In a private project, only team members can access artifacts.
* In a public project, all users can read artifacts, while only team members can create or modify them.
* In an open project, all users can read and write artifacts.

Artifacts Workflows
-------------------

This section outlines workflows for managing and editing Artifacts. Many workflows utilize [the W&B API](/guides/track/public-api-guide/), a component of [the client library](/ref/python/) that provides access to W&B-stored data.

198 - Why am I seeing fewer data points than I logged?
======================================================

When visualizing metrics against an X-axis other than `Step`, expect to see fewer data points. Metrics must log at the same `Step` to remain synchronized. Only metrics logged at the same `Step` are sampled while interpolating between samples.

**Guidelines**

Bundle metrics into a single `log()` call. For example, instead of:

```
wandb.log({"Precision": precision})
...
wandb.log({"Recall": recall})

```

Use:

```
wandb.log({"Precision": precision, "Recall": recall})

```

For manual control over the step parameter, synchronize metrics in the code as follows:

```
wandb.log({"Precision": precision}, step=step)
...
wandb.log({"Recall": recall}, step=step)

```

Ensure the `step` value remains the same in both `log()` calls for the metrics to log under the same step and sample together. The `step` value must increase monotonically in each call. Otherwise, the `step` value is ignored.

199 - Why are steps missing from a CSV metric export?
=====================================================

Export limits can prevent the entire run history from being exported as a CSV or using the `run.history` API. To access the complete run history, download the run history artifact using Parquet format:

```
import wandb
import pandas as pd

run = wandb.init()
artifact = run.use_artifact('<entity>/<project>/<run-id>-history:v0', type='wandb-history')
artifact_dir = artifact.download()
df = pd.read_parquet('<path to .parquet file>')

```

200 - Why does the storage meter not update after deleting runs?
================================================================

* The storage meter does not update immediately after deleting runs due to processing delays.
* The backend system requires time to synchronize and reflect changes in usage accurately.
* If the storage meter has not updated, wait for the changes to process.

201 - Why is a run marked crashed in W&B when it’s training fine locally?
=========================================================================

This indicates a connection problem. If the server loses internet access and data stops syncing to W&B, the system marks the run as crashed after a brief retry period.

202 - Why is nothing showing up in my graphs?
=============================================

If the message “No visualization data logged yet” appears, the script has not executed the first `wandb.log` call. This situation may occur if the run takes a long time to complete a step. To expedite data logging, log multiple times per epoch instead of only at the end.

203 - Why is the same metric appearing more than once?
======================================================

When logging various data types under the same key, split them in the database. This results in multiple entries of the same metric name in the UI dropdown. The data types grouped are `number`, `string`, `bool`, `other` (primarily arrays), and any `wandb` data type such as `Histogram` or `Image`. Send only one type per key to prevent this issue.

Metric names are case-insensitive. Avoid using names that differ only by case, such as `"My-Metric"` and `"my-metric"`.

204 - Will wandb slow down my training?
=======================================

W&B has a minimal impact on training performance under normal usage conditions. Normal use includes logging at a rate of less than once per second and limiting data to a few megabytes per step. W&B operates in a separate process with non-blocking function calls, ensuring that brief network outages or intermittent disk read/write issues do not disrupt performance. Excessive logging of large amounts of data may lead to disk I/O issues. For further inquiries, contact support.

=====================

Keep track of metrics, videos, custom plots, and more

  4 minute read

Log a dictionary of metrics, media, or custom objects to a step with the W&B Python SDK. W&B collects the key-value pairs during each step and stores them in one unified dictionary each time you log data with `wandb.log()`. Data logged from your script is saved locally to your machine in a directory called `wandb`, then synced to the W&B cloud or your [private server](/guides/hosting/).

Key-value pairs are stored in one unified dictionary only if you pass the same value for each step. W&B writes all of the collected keys and values to memory if you log a different value for `step`.

Each call to `wandb.log` is a new `step` by default. W&B uses steps as the default x-axis when it creates charts and panels. You can optionally create and use a custom x-axis or capture a custom summary metric. For more information, see [Customize log axes](/guides/track/log/customize-logging-axes/).




Use `wandb.log()` to log consecutive values for each `step`: 0, 1, 2, and so on. It is not possible to write to a specific history step. W&B only writes to the “current” and “next” step.

Automatically logged data
-------------------------

W&B automatically logs the following information during a W&B Experiment:

* **System metrics**: CPU and GPU utilization, network, etc. These are shown in the System tab on the [run page](/guides/runs/). For the GPU, these are fetched with [`nvidia-smi`](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface).
* **Command line**: The stdout and stderr are picked up and show in the logs tab on the [run page.](/guides/runs/)

Turn on [Code Saving](http://wandb.me/code-save-colab) in your account’s [Settings page](https://wandb.ai/settings) to log:

* **Git commit**: Pick up the latest git commit and see it on the overview tab of the run page, as well as a `diff.patch` file if there are any uncommitted changes.
* **Dependencies**: The `requirements.txt` file will be uploaded and shown on the files tab of the run page, along with any files you save to the `wandb` directory for the run.

What data is logged with specific W&B API calls?
------------------------------------------------

With W&B, you can decide exactly what you want to log. The following lists some commonly logged objects:

* **Datasets**: You have to specifically log images or other dataset samples for them to stream to W&B.
* **Plots**: Use `wandb.plot` with `wandb.log` to track charts. See [Log Plots](/guides/track/log/plots/) for more information.
* **Tables**: Use `wandb.Table` to log data to visualize and query with W&B. See [Log Tables](/guides/track/log/log-tables/) for more information.
* **PyTorch gradients**: Add `wandb.watch(model)` to see gradients of the weights as histograms in the UI.
* **Configuration information**: Log hyperparameters, a link to your dataset, or the name of the architecture you’re using as config parameters, passed in like this: `wandb.init(config=your_config_dictionary)`. See the [PyTorch Integrations](/guides/integrations/pytorch/) page for more information.
* **Metrics**: Use `wandb.log` to see metrics from your model. If you log metrics like accuracy and loss from inside your training loop, you’ll get live updating graphs in the UI.

Common workflows
----------------

1. **Compare the best accuracy**: To compare the best value of a metric across runs, set the summary value for that metric. By default, summary is set to the last value you logged for each key. This is useful in the table in the UI, where you can sort and filter runs based on their summary metrics, to help compare runs in a table or bar chart based on their *best* accuracy, instead of final accuracy. For example: `wandb.run.summary["best_accuracy"] = best_accuracy`
2. **View multiple metrics on one chart**: Log multiple metrics in the same call to `wandb.log`, like this: `wandb.log({"acc'": 0.9, "loss": 0.1})` and they will both be available to plot against in the UI
3. **Customize the x-axis**: Add a custom x-axis to the same log call to visualize your metrics against a different axis in the W&B dashboard. For example: `wandb.log({'acc': 0.9, 'epoch': 3, 'batch': 117})`. To set the default x-axis for a given metric use [Run.define\_metric()](/ref/python/run/#define_metric)
4. **Log rich media and charts**: `wandb.log` supports the logging of a wide variety of data types, from [media like images and videos](/guides/track/log/media/) to [tables](/guides/track/log/log-tables/) and [charts](/guides/app/features/custom-charts/).

=======================

Training and inference at scale made simple, efficient and adaptable

  2 minute read

Hugging Face Accelerate is a library that enables the same PyTorch code to run across any distributed configuration, to simplify model training and inference at scale.

Accelerate includes a Weights & Biases Tracker which we show how to use below. You can also read more about Accelerate Trackers in **[their docs here](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage_guides/tracking)**

Start logging with Accelerate
-----------------------------

To get started with Accelerate and Weights & Biases you can follow the pseudocode below:

```
from accelerate import Accelerator

# Tell the Accelerator object to log with wandb
accelerator = Accelerator(log_with="wandb")

# Initialise your wandb run, passing wandb parameters and any config information
accelerator.init_trackers(
    project_name="my_project", 
    config={"dropout": 0.1, "learning_rate": 1e-2}
    init_kwargs={"wandb": {"entity": "my-wandb-team"}}
    )

...

# Log to wandb by calling `accelerator.log`, `step` is optional
accelerator.log({"train_loss": 1.12, "valid_loss": 0.8}, step=global_step)


# Make sure that the wandb tracker finishes correctly
accelerator.end_training()

```

Explaining more, you need to:

1. Pass `log_with="wandb"` when initialising the Accelerator class
2. Call the [`init_trackers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/package_reference/accelerator#accelerate.Accelerator.init_trackers) method and pass it:

* a project name via `project_name`
* any parameters you want to pass to [`wandb.init`](/ref/python/init/) via a nested dict to `init_kwargs`
* any other experiment config information you want to log to your wandb run, via `config`

3. Use the `.log` method to log to Weigths & Biases; the `step` argument is optional
4. Call `.end_training` when finished training

Access the W&B tracker
----------------------

To access the W&B tracker, use the `Accelerator.get_tracker()` method. Pass in the string corresponding to a tracker’s `.name` attribute, which returns the tracker on the `main` process.

```
wandb_tracker = accelerator.get_tracker("wandb")

```

From there you can interact with wandb’s run object like normal:

```
wandb_tracker.log_artifact(some_artifact_to_log)

```

Trackers built in Accelerate will automatically execute on the correct process, so if a tracker is only meant to be ran on the main process it will do so automatically.

If you want to truly remove Accelerate’s wrapping entirely, you can achieve the same outcome with:

```
wandb_tracker = accelerator.get_tracker("wandb", unwrap=True)
with accelerator.on_main_process:
    wandb_tracker.log_artifact(some_artifact_to_log)

```

=======================

  2 minute read

Authenticate your credentials with the W&B Server LDAP server. The following guide explains how to configure the settings for W&B Server. It covers mandatory and optional configurations, as well as instructions for configuring the LDAP connection from systems settings UI. it also provides information on the different inputs of the LDAP configuration, such as the address, base distinguished name, and attributes. You can specify these attributes from the W&B App UI or using environment variables. You can setup either an anonymous bind, or bind with an administrator DN and Password.

Only W&B Admin roles can enable and configure LDAP authentication.

Configure LDAP connection
-------------------------

* W&B App
* Environment variable

1. Navigate to the W&B App.
2. Select your profile icon from the upper right. From the dropdown, select **System Settings**.
3. Toggle **Configure LDAP Client**.
4. Add the details in the form. Refer to **Configuring Parameters** section for details on each input.
5. Click on **Update Settings** to test your settings. This will establish a test client/connection with the W&B server.
6. If your connection is verified, toggle the **Enable LDAP Authentication** and select the **Update Settings** button.

Set LDAP an connection with the following environment variables:

| Environment variable | Required | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LOCAL_LDAP_ADDRESS` | Yes | `ldaps://ldap.example.com:636` |
| `LOCAL_LDAP_BASE_DN` | Yes | `email=mail,group=gidNumber` |
| `LOCAL_LDAP_BIND_DN` | No | `cn=admin`, `dc=example,dc=org` |
| `LOCAL_LDAP_BIND_PW` | No |  |
| `LOCAL_LDAP_ATTRIBUTES` | Yes | `email=mail`, `group=gidNumber` |
| `LOCAL_LDAP_TLS_ENABLE` | No |  |
| `LOCAL_LDAP_GROUP_ALLOW_LIST` | No |  |
| `LOCAL_LDAP_LOGIN` | No |  |

See the [Configuration parameters](/guides/hosting/iam/ldap/#configuration-parameters) section for definitions of each environment variable. Note that the environment variable prefix `LOCAL_LDAP` was omitted from the definition names for clarity.

Configuration parameters
------------------------

The following table lists and describes required and optional LDAP configurations.

| Environment variable | Definition | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ADDRESS` | This is the address of your LDAP server within the VPC that hosts W&B Server. | Yes |
| `BASE_DN` | The root path searches start from and required for doing any queries into this directory. | Yes |
| `BIND_DN` | Path of the administrative user registered in the LDAP server. This is required if the LDAP server does not support unauthenticated binding. If specified, W&B Server connects to the LDAP server as this user. Otherwise, W&B Server connects using anonymous binding. | No |
| `BIND_PW` | The password for administrative user, this is used to authenticate the binding. If left blank, W&B Server connects using anonymous binding. | No |
| `ATTRIBUTES` | Provide an email and group ID attribute names as comma separated string values. | Yes |
| `TLS_ENABLE` | Enable TLS. | No |
| `GROUP_ALLOW_LIST` | Group allowlist. | No |
| `LOGIN` | This tells W&B Server to use LDAP to authenticate. Set to either `True` or `False`. Optionally set this to false to test the LDAP configuration. Set this to true to start LDAP authentication. | No |

==============

Ways to manage W&B data storage.

  less than a minute

If you are approaching or exceeding your storage limit, there are multiple paths forward to manage your data. The path that’s best for you will depend on your account type and your current project setup.

Manage storage consumption
--------------------------

W&B offers different methods of optimizing your storage consumption:

* Use [reference artifacts](/guides/artifacts/track-external-files/) to track files saved outside the W&B system, instead of uploading them to W&B storage.
* Use an [external cloud storage bucket](/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams/) for storage. *(Enterprise only)*

Delete data
-----------

You can also choose to delete data to remain under your storage limit. There are several ways to do this:

* Delete data interactively with the app UI.
* [Set a TTL policy](/guides/artifacts/ttl/) on Artifacts so they are automatically deleted.

 [PDF](/guides/models/app/settings-page/_print/)Tutorial: Define, initialize, and run a sweep
=============================================

Sweeps quickstart shows how to define, initialize, and run a sweep. There are four main steps

  3 minute read

This page shows how to define, initialize, and run a sweep. There are four main steps:

1. [Set up your training code](#set-up-your-training-code)
2. [Define the search space with a sweep configuration](#define-the-search-space-with-a-sweep-configuration)
3. [Initialize the sweep](#initialize-the-sweep)
4. [Start the sweep agent](#start-the-sweep)

Copy and paste the following code into a Jupyter Notebook or Python script:

```
# Import the W&B Python Library and log into W&B
import wandb

wandb.login()

# 1: Define objective/training function
def objective(config):
    score = config.x**3 + config.y
    return score

def main():
    wandb.init(project="my-first-sweep")
    score = objective(wandb.config)
    wandb.log({"score": score})

# 2: Define the search space
sweep_configuration = {
    "method": "random",
    "metric": {"goal": "minimize", "name": "score"},
    "parameters": {
        "x": {"max": 0.1, "min": 0.01},
        "y": {"values": [1, 3, 7]},
    },
}

# 3: Start the sweep
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_configuration, project="my-first-sweep")

wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=main, count=10)

```

The following sections break down and explains each step in the code sample.

Set up your training code
-------------------------

Define a training function that takes in hyperparameter values from `wandb.config` and uses them to train a model and return metrics.

Optionally provide the name of the project where you want the output of the W&B Run to be stored (project parameter in [`wandb.init`](/ref/python/init/)). If the project is not specified, the run is put in an “Uncategorized” project.

Both the sweep and the run must be in the same project. Therefore, the name you provide when you initialize W&B must match the name of the project you provide when you initialize a sweep.

```
# 1: Define objective/training function
def objective(config):
    score = config.x**3 + config.y
    return score


def main():
    wandb.init(project="my-first-sweep")
    score = objective(wandb.config)
    wandb.log({"score": score})

```

Define the search space with a sweep configuration
--------------------------------------------------

Within a dictionary, specify what hyperparameters you want to sweep over and. For more information about configuration options, see [Define sweep configuration](/guides/sweeps/define-sweep-configuration/).

The proceeding example demonstrates a sweep configuration that uses a random search (`'method':'random'`). The sweep will randomly select a random set of values listed in the configuration for the batch size, epoch, and the learning rate.

Throughout the sweeps, W&B will maximize the metric specified in the metric key (`metric`). In the following example, W&B will maximize (`'goal':'maximize'`) the validation accuracy (`'val_acc'`).

```
# 2: Define the search space
sweep_configuration = {
    "method": "random",
    "metric": {"goal": "minimize", "name": "score"},
    "parameters": {
        "x": {"max": 0.1, "min": 0.01},
        "y": {"values": [1, 3, 7]},
    },
}

```

Initialize the Sweep
--------------------

W&B uses a *Sweep Controller* to manage sweeps on the cloud (standard), locally (local) across one or more machines. For more information about Sweep Controllers, see [Search and stop algorithms locally](/guides/sweeps/local-controller/).

A sweep identification number is returned when you initialize a sweep:

```
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_configuration, project="my-first-sweep")

```

For more information about initializing sweeps, see [Initialize sweeps](/guides/sweeps/initialize-sweeps/).

Start the Sweep
---------------

Use the [`wandb.agent`](/ref/python/agent/) API call to start a sweep.

```
wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=main, count=10)

```

Visualize results (optional)
----------------------------

Open your project to see your live results in the W&B App dashboard. With just a few clicks, construct rich, interactive charts like [parallel coordinates plots](/guides/app/features/panels/parallel-coordinates/), [parameter importance analyzes](/guides/app/features/panels/parameter-importance/), and [more](/guides/app/features/panels/).

![Sweeps Dashboard example](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/sweeps/quickstart_dashboard_example.png)

For more information about how to visualize results, see [Visualize sweep results](/guides/sweeps/visualize-sweep-results/). For an example dashboard, see this sample [Sweeps Project](https://wandb.ai/anmolmann/pytorch-cnn-fashion/sweeps/pmqye6u3).

Stop the agent (optional)
-------------------------

From the terminal, hit `Ctrl+c` to stop the run that the Sweep agent is currently running. To kill the agent, hit `Ctrl+c` again after the run is stopped.

=================

  7 minute read

[Try in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wandb/examples/blob/master/colabs/intro/Intro_to_Weights_&_Biases.ipynb)

Use [W&B](https://wandb.ai/site) for machine learning experiment tracking, model checkpointing, collaboration with your team and more.

In this notebook, you will create and track a machine learning experiment using a simple PyTorch model. By the end of the notebook, you will have an interactive project dashboard that you can share and customize with other members of your team. [View an example dashboard here](https://wandb.ai/wandb/wandb_example).

Prerequisites
-------------

Install the W&B Python SDK and log in:

```
!pip install wandb -qU

```

```
# Log in to your W&B account
import wandb
import random
import math

# Use wandb-core, temporary for wandb's new backend
wandb.require("core")

```

```
wandb.login()

```

Simulate and track a machine learning experiment with W&B
---------------------------------------------------------

Create, track, and visualize a machine learning experiment. To do this:

1. Initialize a [W&B run](/guides/runs/) and pass in the hyperparameters you want to track.
2. Within your training loop, log metrics such as the accuruacy and loss.

```
import random
import math

# Launch 5 simulated experiments
total_runs = 5
for run in range(total_runs):
  # 1️. Start a new run to track this script
  wandb.init(
      # Set the project where this run will be logged
      project="basic-intro",
      # We pass a run name (otherwise it’ll be randomly assigned, like sunshine-lollypop-10)
      name=f"experiment_{run}",
      # Track hyperparameters and run metadata
      config={
      "learning_rate": 0.02,
      "architecture": "CNN",
      "dataset": "CIFAR-100",
      "epochs": 10,
      })

  # This simple block simulates a training loop logging metrics
  epochs = 10
  offset = random.random() / 5
  for epoch in range(2, epochs):
      acc = 1 - 2 ** -epoch - random.random() / epoch - offset
      loss = 2 ** -epoch + random.random() / epoch + offset

      # 2️. Log metrics from your script to W&B
      wandb.log({"acc": acc, "loss": loss})

  # Mark the run as finished
  wandb.finish()

```

View how your machine learning peformed in your W&B project. Copy and paste the URL link that is printed from the previous cell. The URL will redirect you to a W&B project that contains a dashboard showing graphs the show how

The following image shows what a dashboard can look like:

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/tutorials/experiments-1.png)

Now that we know how to integrate W&B into a psuedo machine learning training loop, let’s track a machine learning experiment using a basic PyTorch neural network. The following code will also upload model checkpoints to W&B that you can then share with other teams in your organization.

Track a machine learning experiment using Pytorch
-------------------------------------------------

The following code cell defines and trains a simple MNIST classifier. During training, you will see W&B prints out URLs. Click on the project page link to see your results stream in live to a W&B project.

W&B runs automatically log [metrics](/guides/runs/#workspace-tab),
[system information](/guides/runs/#system-tab),
[hyperparameters](/guides/runs/#overview-tab),
[terminal output](/guides/runs/#logs-tab) and
you’ll see an [interactive table](/guides/models/tables/)
with model inputs and outputs.

### Set up PyTorch Dataloader

The following cell defines some useful functions that we will need to train our machine learning model. The functions themselves are not unique to W&B so we’ll not cover them in detail here. See the PyTorch documentation for more information on how to define [forward and backward training loop](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html), how to use [PyTorch DataLoaders](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html) to load data in for training, and how define PyTorch models using the [`torch.nn.Sequential` Class](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html).

```
# @title

    )
    sub_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(
        full_dataset, indices=range(0, len(full_dataset), slice)
    )
    loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        dataset=sub_dataset,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        shuffle=True if is_train else False,
        pin_memory=True,
        num_workers=2,
    )
    return loader


def get_model(dropout):
    "A simple model"
    model = nn.Sequential(
        nn.Flatten(),
        nn.Linear(28 * 28, 256),
        nn.BatchNorm1d(256),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.Dropout(dropout),
        nn.Linear(256, 10),
    ).to(device)
    return model


def validate_model(model, valid_dl, loss_func, log_images=False, batch_idx=0):
    "Compute performance of the model on the validation dataset and log a wandb.Table"
    model.eval()
    val_loss = 0.0
    with torch.inference_mode():
        correct = 0
        for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(valid_dl):
            images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)

            # Forward pass ➡
            outputs = model(images)
            val_loss += loss_func(outputs, labels) * labels.size(0)

            # Compute accuracy and accumulate
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

            # Log one batch of images to the dashboard, always same batch_idx.
            if i == batch_idx and log_images:
                log_image_table(images, predicted, labels, outputs.softmax(dim=1))
    return val_loss / len(valid_dl.dataset), correct / len(valid_dl.dataset)

```

### Create a teble to compare the predicted values versus the true value

The following cell is unique to W&B, so let’s go over it.

In the cell we define a function called `log_image_table`. Though technically, optional, this function creates a W&B Table object. We will use the table object to create a table that shows what the model predicted for each image.

More specifically, each row will conists of the image fed to the model, along with predicted value and the actual value (label).

```
def log_image_table(images, predicted, labels, probs):
    "Log a wandb.Table with (img, pred, target, scores)"
    # Create a wandb Table to log images, labels and predictions to
    table = wandb.Table(
        columns=["image", "pred", "target"] + [f"score_{i}" for i in range(10)]
    )
    for img, pred, targ, prob in zip(
        images.to("cpu"), predicted.to("cpu"), labels.to("cpu"), probs.to("cpu")
    ):
        table.add_data(wandb.Image(img[0].numpy() * 255), pred, targ, *prob.numpy())
    wandb.log({"predictions_table": table}, commit=False)

```

### Train your model and upload checkpoints

The following code trains and saves model checkpoints to your project. Use model checkpoints like you normally would to assess how the model performed during training.

W&B also makes it easy to share your saved models and model checkpoints with other members of your team or organization. To learn how to share your model and model checkpoints with members outside of your team, see [W&B Registry](/guides/core/registry/).

                "train/example_ct": example_ct,
            }

            if step + 1 < n_steps_per_epoch:
                # Log train metrics to wandb
                wandb.log(metrics)

            step_ct += 1

        val_loss, accuracy = validate_model(
            model, valid_dl, loss_func, log_images=(epoch == (config.epochs - 1))
        )

        # Log train and validation metrics to wandb
        val_metrics = {"val/val_loss": val_loss, "val/val_accuracy": accuracy}
        wandb.log({**metrics, **val_metrics})

        # Save the model checkpoint to wandb
        torch.save(model, "my_model.pt")
        wandb.log_model(
            "./my_model.pt",
            "my_mnist_model",
            aliases=[f"epoch-{epoch+1}_dropout-{round(wandb.config.dropout, 4)}"],
        )

        print(
            f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Train Loss: {train_loss:.3f}, Valid Loss: {val_loss:3f}, Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}"
        )

    # If you had a test set, this is how you could log it as a Summary metric
    wandb.summary["test_accuracy"] = 0.8

    # Close your wandb run
    wandb.finish()

```

You have now trained your first model using W&B. Click on one of the links above to see your metrics and see your saved model checkpoints in the Artifacts tab in the W&B App UI

(Optional) Set up a W&B Alert
-----------------------------

Create a [W&B Alerts](/guides/runs/alert/) to send alerts to your Slack or email from your Python code.

There are 2 steps to follow the first time you’d like to send a Slack or email alert, triggered from your code:

1. Turn on Alerts in your W&B [User Settings](https://wandb.ai/settings)
2. Add `wandb.alert()` to your code. For example:

```
wandb.alert(title="Low accuracy", text=f"Accuracy is below the acceptable threshold")

```

The following cell shows a minimal example below to see how to use `wandb.alert`

```
# Start a wandb run
wandb.init(project="pytorch-intro")

# Simulating a model training loop
acc_threshold = 0.3
for training_step in range(1000):

    # Generate a random number for accuracy
    accuracy = round(random.random() + random.random(), 3)
    print(f"Accuracy is: {accuracy}, {acc_threshold}")

    # Log accuracy to wandb
    wandb.log({"Accuracy": accuracy})

    # If the accuracy is below the threshold, fire a W&B Alert and stop the run
    if accuracy <= acc_threshold:
        # Send the wandb Alert
        wandb.alert(
            title="Low Accuracy",
            text=f"Accuracy {accuracy} at step {training_step} is below the acceptable theshold, {acc_threshold}",
        )
        print("Alert triggered")
        break

# Mark the run as finished (useful in Jupyter notebooks)
wandb.finish()

```

You can find the full docs for [W&B Alerts here](/guides/runs/alert/).

======

Iterate on datasets and understand model predictions

  less than a minute

[Try in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wandb/examples/blob/master/colabs/datasets-predictions/W%26B_Tables_Quickstart.ipynb)
[Try in W&B](https://wandb.ai/wandb/examples/reports/AlphaFold-ed-Proteins-in-W-B-Tables--Vmlldzo4ODc0MDc)

Use W&B Tables to visualize and query tabular data. For example:

* Compare how different models perform on the same test set
* Identify patterns in your data
* Look at sample model predictions visually
* Query to find commonly misclassified examples

![](https://docs.wandb.ai/images/data_vis/tables_sample_predictions.png)
The above image shows a table with semantic segmentation and custom metrics. View this table here in this [sample project from the W&B ML Course](https://wandb.ai/av-team/mlops-course-001).

How it works
------------

A Table is a two-dimensional grid of data where each column has a single type of data. Tables support primitive and numeric types, as well as nested lists, dictionaries, and rich media types.

Log a Table
-----------

Log a table with a few lines of code:

* [`wandb.init()`](/ref/python/init/): Create a [run](/guides/runs/) to track results.
* [`wandb.Table()`](/ref/python/data-types/table/): Create a new table object.
  + `columns`: Set the column names.
  + `data`: Set the contents of the table.
* [`run.log()`](/ref/python/log/): Log the table to save it to W&B.

```
import wandb

run = wandb.init(project="table-test")
my_table = wandb.Table(columns=["a", "b"], data=[["a1", "b1"], ["a2", "b2"]])
run.log({"Table Name": my_table})

```

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)
------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

[L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

[N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

[O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)
--------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)
------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

[L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

[O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)
--------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;

[P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved.

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)
------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

[L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

[M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen.

This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)
------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

[L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

[M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

[N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)
----------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

[O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)
--------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

[P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)
------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

[M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)
------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

[L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

[M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

[N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)
----------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

[O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)
--------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

[P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)
------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

[L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

[M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

[N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)
----------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

[O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)
--------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

[P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

[L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.

[The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: November 16, 2020

[A. Definitions](#a-definitions)
--------------------------------

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

[B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

[C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)
--------------------------------------

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

[D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

[E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)
--------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

[F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing [copyright@github.com](mailto:copyright@github.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

[G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved.

[H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)
----------------------------

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

[I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

[J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)
------------------------------------

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

[K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

[L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

[N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

[O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)
--------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;

[P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

[Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)
------------------------------------------------------

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement.
